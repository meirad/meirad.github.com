I just read a piece by the inventor of the tech sabbath. He says, we should go beyond the tech sabbath by making our devices stop making us 911 operators. I thought everyone knew this. I've been practicing this for over a year. Here's my set up.

Nexus 4 (unlocked):
- firefox browser
- Meditation app
- Yoga app
- Two Zombie games
- Zombies Run
- Music
- To do app
- Dextr personal email sorting

I've turned off all alerts and give only people that I want to have my number my number. Everyone else that demands my number get's into a mini war. I don't have a phone contract, so I'm not notified to pay my bill every few days. I don't instant message, I don't use Instagram, and I don't use Google+ or Facebook. I am on Twitter for a trial run, but I might leave it too. If you blank slate, you don't get notifications. Constanly work your technology over until you reach tech nirvana. 

Here's some rules of thumb. 

- Television is not your lover. Don't spend more time with it than with those you love. Ditch satellite t.v. Studies show that the news is actually bad for your health. Don't watch it, get any pertinent information (weather) from your phone.
- I spend less than 30 minutes a day max on the internet, 15 minutes minimum. I challege you to do the same for all personal web surfing. This includes looking at websites on your phone. Get rid of your gaming apps, except for a handful (less than five) favorites. They leach your time too.
- No one truely needs to listen to the radio, don't turn it on.
- When your phone rings, check the i.d. Only answer if it is super important or family. Never use your phone when out at dinner. Kill texting. I instant message only two people and then we usually schedule it for times when neither of us are busy, so we can text an entire conversation that we normally wouldn't put into an email.
- Guard your email. Family, close friends, that's all that should be in your inbox. Write like you would a letter. People will respect that, but don't write the magna carta. Practice inbox zero.
- Don't buy an ipad. Minimize your gadgets. Cellphone, computer, ipod, ereader. This alone is a handful of junk. If you can put all your music on your phone do it and get rid of the ipod. Recycle all your electronics. Don't impulse buy apps.

*You should spend no more than an hour a day on the computer. Unless you are a designer, programmer etc. Even then, if not working from home, limit it to less than three hours. Nothing should keep you on there. Port all your digital books to the ereader and head to the park with your dog. Go outside.

There should be times when it is so silent in your house you could hear a pin drop. No notifications, no distractions, you aren't being pulled or pushed in any direction. Your just being still. This is what our lives were like before technology entered into the picture. We can still have that too. 

Our technology was built to make our lives have more of this still time. But someone it got ensnared into corporate greed which peverted it for it's own gain. Don't let that happen to your technology. Find a balance. Hint: it isn't 50/50. It's more like 20/80 or 10/90. The 80 or 90% being your still time. So go and find your still time. Take back what was always yours and dwell in the silence of not being bullied by corporations.
