Your superhero is there when life sends a cosmic meteor of shit your way and he or she is seemingly unaffected. You know why? Because that little part of you, that inner superhero has a lot going for him. He knows that things can always be fixed and that sometimes life has to change in order to make you “super”. Sometimes we don’t recognize the “super” in us, but see it in others. We idolize those people who seems to have everything going for them, or the person who ran into a burning building to save a kitten. We idolize those who appear to have certain qualities that we don’t believe ourselves to have and we call them, "Our Heroes". One thing we fail to realize through all of this though is that everyone can be a hero. We just haven’t turned used our super powers in so long that we’ve forgotten how to use them. So, just like superhero’s in training, there are those of us that feel the weight of the world on their shoulders, those who sporadically activate their powers and have some great days while other days are complete failures, and then there’s the ones who seemingly shoot through the air like Iron Man on a mission to kick corporate or even life’s ass.</p>  <p>So, where do you fit in? Are you on the bottom rung of superhero in training? If so, Iâ€™m glad you’re here. Because that’s where I am too. Together we defeat the cosmic meteors of shit and gain the status of Super Hero. Just remember, it was always there within you. So, where exactly do I fit into this picture as a super hero in training? Well, it’s been rough. I grew up in the desert and as all super heroes in training, I’ve had a lot of adventures, stumbles, and just plain dead ends in my life. I grew up traveling throughout Arizona and New Mexico, tripping on rocks, cursing scorpions, and attempting to avoid all rattle snakes. In the end, I managed to avoid the snakes. What I did’t manage to do was avoid the rabid dogs, a lost moose, gun flights, knife stand off’s, giant lizards from hell, at least ten wolves, and one very big grizzly bear. So how did I make it? I think it had a lot to do with my inner superhero. You see, when we’re kids, your super powers aren’t lost. Our super powers tend to disappear later in life. So, I wasn’t affected by most of the crap that happened around me. In fact, I was all just one big adventure. ...To make a long story short, I outran the bear. I also made it through pretty much everything that came across my path. I ended up going to the Grand Canyon, having a snowball fight after a tornado tried to take out our house and left mysterious mounds of cold white fluff, and watched ceremonies done by a medicine man on the rez. Then we moved.</p>  <p>That’s when things took a turn for the worst. We lived in a basement for a while, then a house. The house ended up being haunted. If you have been graced with the good fortune as to not ever of had to deal with a haunted house, I commend you. I gained weight, my parents lost their jobs, I dropped out of school. I was spiraling, my super powers had been switched off. I stopped listening to people who were and weren’t talking to me, because of all of the worries and problems that were flying around in my head like demonic flying monkey’s. In order to feel like I was worth something and that I was being “productive” or contributing some way to society, I started doing anything that would keep me busy. I had to constantly being doing something in order to feel like I had a purpose. Then, I started to slip towards depression. It seemed the entire world was against me. It was to some extent, but I greatly over exaggerated it. The real villain in my life was me. Somehow I had gone from a super hero in training to a villain.</p>  <p>I had turned into a vortex of swirling dark emotions, the bad guy, the anti-hero. I was furious. It was that fury that ended up propelling me into turning on my super powers. I quickly logged on to the computer and registered for college to get my associates. Within the next two years, I learned to code HTML and CSS, rescued a border collie, started drawing, writing, practicing yoga, and learning minimalism and stoicism. I didn’t finish college, several things happened recently that ended up shaking those dreams into the dust of the earth. But that’s ok, even if I never get to finish my degrees, because Iâ€™m not shaken by it anymore. There will always be villains in the guise of cataclysmic disasters and sinister manipulators, that’s not what matters. What truly matters is that you can activate your super powers and float right past adversity, even thrive in adversity, without one dreaded flying monkey filling your head. </p><hr>      <br><br>        <center><a href="<!---place paypal or other shoppingcart web link here.=-->"><button class="button" style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: 300;">Buy Now | $29</button></a><p>*If GitTip works out, I'll be offering the web version for free. </p></center><br><br><hr>  <br><br><br>      </article>        <div class="five columns offset-by-one sidebar">    <img src="meirad.jpg"  style="border: 1px solid; #ccc; padding: 4px; margin-bottom: 1em;" >         <h2>Hi, I'm Meira.</h2>  <p> Learning the Dark Arts of <a href="http://www.github.com/meirad">Web Developement</a>, in a small town where wifi is a rare link to the outside world. </p> <p>Interesting Reading: <a href="http://www.gwenbell.com">Gwen Bell</a>, <a href="http://www.zenhabits.net">ZenHabits</a>, <a href="http://www.mnmlist.com">Mnmlist</a> </p> <p>You  can now find me in the Twitterverse @ <a href="http://www.twitter.com/meiradatiya">meiradatiya</a></p><br> <a href="vanquishmindsmog.html"><img src= "mindsmog2.jpg" "style="border: 1px solid; #ccc; padding: 4px; margin-bottom: 1em;"/></a></a>      <center><script>var CoinWidget_Config = {	address : '11oWesLztFeHsfzLc9oodpMv8W3LC92uc'};</script><script src="http://c.coinwidget.com/widget.js"></script><br><br><script data-gittip-username="meiradatiya"src="https://www.gittip.com/assets/widgets/0002.js"></script></center><br><br>      </div>    </div>    </div>  </div></div></section>    </div>    <script type="text/javascript" src="/Index/prettify.js"></script>    <script type="text/javascript" src="/Index/jquery.js"></script>    <script type="text/javascript" src="/Index/bootstrap.js"></script>    <script type="text/javascript" src="/Index/script.js"></script>        </script><iframe src="index/widget.html" id="coinbase_modal_iframe_e284433f66f1c5204bb0642cb11a555a" name="coinbase_modal_iframe_e284433f66f1c5204bb0642cb11a555a" style="background-color: transparent; border: 0px none transparent; overflow: hidden; display: none; position: fixed; visibility: visible; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; left: 0px; top: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; z-index: 9999;" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>         <script>HummingbirdTracker.track();</script>       </body></html>
