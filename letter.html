Unfortunately, I have had absolutely no idea what that entails. So, I've decided to do it by blending past and present together to create a set of missions or goals to hit. The first of these goals, inspired by <a href="https://www.diy.org">DIY.org</a> is <strong>Bicycle Mechanic</strong>. </p><p>The coming weeks will be dedicated to tool aquisition and the building of a tool kit. According to DIY's website a small list of materials should include the following:</p><ul><li>Adjustable Wrench</li><li>Cone Wrench</li><li>Philips Screwdriver</li><li>Cable Cutters</li><li>Crank Puller</li><li>Repair Stand</li><li>Chain Tool</li><li>Metrix Hex Keys</li><li>Spoke Wrench</li><li>Chain Whip</li><li>Patch Kit</li><li>Tire Levers</li></ul><p>It's a good starting list, that's for sure. But if you're like me and bought an awesome bicycle that's been stripped down past the necessities. There's some things you gotta add to this list. </p><ul><li> oil</li><li>Steel Scrubber</li><li>WD-40</li><li>Bell</li><li>Tire Inner Tubes</li><li>Lights</li><li>Glue</li><li>Basket or paniers</li><li>Caps for tires</li><li>Water bottle holder & Steel Water bottle</li><li>Bike fenders</li></ul><p> The oil and steel scrubber are excellent for getting rid of any and all rust on your bicycle in just moments. WD-40 is kind of self explanatory. The inner tubes? Well, you cannot have enough of them if you live in a rural area where it can take 40+ minutes to find a shop that may or may not sell extra's. Caps tend to disappear when needed most and your handle bars are sure to fall off, or if made of rubber rot in hot temperatures. The rest is just convience and safety options that should have come with your bicycle. If they didn't, then you better get'em.</p><p>I think when these two lists are combined, you've got pretty much everything covered except a bike seat, brakes and a backup chain, to rebuild your entire bike and possibly trick it out a little. I would also suggest a tape measure, for seeing what size tires are required for your bike as well.</p><p> Now that I've covered all of that, you might think I'm already a bicycle mechanic. Well, I'm not. I don't know any of the tools of the trade and although somewhat technically inclined, it's going to be an interesting mission that's for sure. So, I'll leave this letter at that. It's time to go dig up some tools. ...</p><hr /><p><a name="football"></a></p><p><center><h4><strong><u>Football</u></strong></h4></center></p><p>So, football. Not my sport. It's not that I don't get the game. I do, but I honestly don't see the point. Everythings expensive, very consumerist. I mean my soda was $9.95, I'm just grateful I had a free drink & hot dog pass. As for the game itself? I was in row UU, the nosebleed section, and what I saw was not worth the $48 dollars. Did you know during commercials they just stop playing? Everyone's drunk, everyone's screaming, some people are paling out from the heights and the players are just taking another break after playing for a minute and a half. I prefer baseball, soccer, lacrosse, these are real games. Full of sweat, blood, broken bones and glory. Football? Not so much. ... </p><p>The upside? I saw some amazing sculptures on the riverfront, discovered a wax museum (Iron Man, Nosferatu, Raptors, the Joker), walked down cobblestone paths and saw three horse carriages. Which sort of made me wonder. Are St.Louis horses under the same unhealthy living conditions as in New York? </p><hr><p><a name="writerread"></a></p><p><center><h4><strong><u>A Sick Writer Reads. ... </u></strong></h4></center></p><p>I've been reading a lot lately to recuperate from a cold. Nothing's sacred since my imagination tends to kaput when ill. I read everything. Recently, that's been a series of short stories by Jack London. He's one of my favorite author's if you didn't know. As well as, Zen and The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance and every once in a while reading some sections of Thoreau's journal. It's hard to read it on my computer screen. But it's worth every moment for the interesting stuff you come across. Other than that in the past three days I've been rotting my brains out watching television (I don't have Netflix or Cable, straight dvd's). So, I've watched the 3 hour King Kong film with Jack Black, Bewitched, Aliens 4, and the entire second season of Teen Wolf. I've also been debating as the whether I should read Friedrich Nietzsche, and Rebel by Albert Camus. All while digging through deer hunting statistics (for no reason whatsoever) and delving into rereading whatever magazines I have. It's crazy. ...</p><p>So, What's a day in my life like lately? To quell your infinite curiosity. I've settled into two different types of days. One where I'm productive and one where i'm lazy.</p><center><p><h5>Productive Day:</h5></p><p>I wake up and brew tea, eating Greek yogurt and powering up my mac. Double clicking iTunes, I listen to some French songs and podcasts. Then swtich over to music from my playlists. When I feel ready, I open Scrivener and Github app and write, logging my progress to put onto my repo later in the day. Afterwards I take a break for lunch which I usually cook from scratch and write in my journal. After lunch I update my website and write more until evening where I then switch to reading on my ereader.</p></center><center><p><h5>Lazy Day:</h5></p><p>These are web days, research days, knowing and learning days. Usually every other day I have one of these. Keeps the mind busy and relaxed. I log online check my RSS feeds and email, upload all my git progress for my website and writing repo's. Then, I check the news to see what is happening in the world, download articles to read and do my research for my book. That's it. Done.</p></center><p>Later I might read the articles or I'll do something else like mini chores or take Oreo for a walk. But I try to keep the days simple. It's not like that all of the time though, some days I visit my brother and that tends to transform the whole day into a traveling lazy day. Where I try to fit in a little bit of research with a lot of visiting and poster making.</p><p>[ <strong>My brother loves to make art requests. He tells me a favorite Disney or cartoon character and I sketch and color him on newsprint with oil pastels. He then works on his own poster while waiting for me to finish and then we hang them on his wall. Each poster takes between 30 minutes and 3 hours.</strong>]</p><p>That's a little bit about me. You wanna make my day? Give me the title of an obsure Jack London novel. I promise to look it up and read it. :) So far, I've read: "To Build A Fire," "Trust," "Call of the Wild," & "Lost Face."</p><hr><p><a name="#writing"></a></p><p><center><h4> <strong><u>Writing & Life Updates </u></strong></h4></center><br><p> I've always wondered what it was like to be a writer. Every time I see one in a movie, whether it's Jewel of the Nile or Nim's Island. The author's always seems strange, she's either drunk, bedazzled by thoughts of romance, or locked in her house terrified to go outside or all three in one. I've never thought of myself that way. </p><p>True, I do spend a lot of time at home, but I don't drink and I definitely don't choke up during scenes in my book. I probably should, maybe there's something on the emotional level that makes a book live. I don't know. But usually, I'm sitting at home drinking tea and cursing the sunlight filtering through the window while I try to channel my darker side and occasionally give my dog a belly rub. If i'm not doing that, i'm surfing the web learning things, walking my dog and attempting to avoid any and all people in the area. It's not that I don't like people, it's that they annoy me. They smile when they don't mean it, they talk just to hear themselves, not allowing anyone else into the conversation. And usually, well, when they do let you in on a conversation, let's just say it's about topics I'd rather not hear or even know about. </p><p>I prefer the company of introverted people. Those who listen, then speak. Those who question instead of assume that's the way things are. The people who wonder, imagine, spark, and ignite, create and do. Genuine people. Artists. Writers who have not been constricted in their views of the world but see the grande scheme of things. Those are the people that make a difference and when they speak, you listen. Not because you have to or you'll seem rude. But because you can't stop listening the mingling of their words with what you yourself have been feeling or thinking all along. That's real. And when they smile at you or give you a scowl, it's a genuine reflection of what they feel at the moment. No false facades, no alterior motives. Just the truth. Plain and simple.</p><p> I suppose I should give an update on my poetry. I guess this is a catch all post. My first poem was rejected by Poetry Magazine. I'm not in the least bit surprise or angry. I didn't receive one of those scarring rejection letters that haunt writers souls, but a neat and respectible one. I've heard that being rejected by Poetry Magazine is a right of passage among writers and the fact that they rejected it in as nice and professional manner as possible, gives me the confidence to keep on writing. I've heard tales where writers were asked never to submit their writing again until they became better etc. And other such horror stores from the Magazine.  So, I was actually relieved when I received mine. I cannot but hope to continue to write better in an attempt to not only gain publishment, but also to perfect it. It will take time, but I hope to submit another poem within the year. </p><p> On to tales of the not so writing kind. My brother is supposed to come home soon. Which means, my writng will stagger considerably. For some strange reason, being around other people stops my writing in its tracks. But, the good news is that my family will all be together again soon. So far we have been scattered across a stretch of fifty or sixty miles in distance between each other, all locked in separate worlds of horror. My mother worrying that my brothers autistic fits will get him taken away. My brother throwing fits because he hasn't been home in over two months. My dad wondering what the heck to do and bouncing back and forth. My sister with a cold and attempting to write a story while comforting our brother. All of this while money stops flowing, the viruses start spreading, lies get told, people panic, and others are just afraid. It's enough to drive anyone mad. </p><p>Today I learned how to encrypt a flash drive for storing my writing in a secure as possible way, in addition to my repo on GitHub. I also, learned that it costs $3.75 to send an envelope of letters to Germany from here if you have the unfortunate luck of the envelope being considered "rigid". Not to mention the possibility of it costing upwards of $5-$15 dollars and possibly filling out customs paperwork. It was definitely a headache, that's for sure. </p><p>Hmm. On top of this, I'm behind on the news. Has anything happened of interest? The last I saw of the news online it seemed Hollywood marriages and separations were more important than finding out what was actually happening in the world. It makes me nauseous thinking about how far we've fallen news wise. </p><p>Also, I'm limiting my web prescence.  If you do a search for me the websites will all be dead. I'm shutting them all down. Only this website will remain. The last thing a writer wants is to be plagued with mass messages from social networks. They are just a distraction from what should be done. I wouldn't click the contact button. I won't receive your messages as I'm switching providers. I will let you know when it's back up though and may provide a temporary service in the meantime. </p><p>P.S. Any reasons you can think of that a single bat would screech and attack a person? Apparently this happened right outside of my house to my sister a few days ago. It rammed into her arm and then flew through her hair. Thankfully there were no bite or scratch marks visible. <hr><p><a name="seasons"></a></p><p><center><h4> <strong><u>Changing of the Seasons </u></strong></h4></center><br><p>A lot has been changing. The weather swishes back and forth between the depths of summer heat and the beauty of a light and cool autumn. My personality is as moody as the weather. … For a long time now, I've felt that someone handed me a foam Nerf sword to battle dragons. The dragons were those of poverty, health collapses in my family, and the struggle to find who I am in comparison to who people want me to be or who they think I should be.</p><p> It's a struggle. ... I live in the middle of nowhere. A small town encompassed by fields of yellowed corn. They were black last year, the summer heat scorched them dry. ... I live in the country, where people drink beer and talk big about winning the powerball, because all opportunity has been sapped, leaving them broken. I was almost one of them. ... Not the drinking part, but the broken part.  I'm still struggling, but I'm getting better. Things change, like the shifting of the seasons, and sometimes change is good. </p> <p> For me it's involved a lot of decisions. Do I listen to what people say around me? About me? How they drag my family name into the dirt out of spite? Do I listen to the dramatic whispers of the church goers? Or do I forge my own path? The answer has been obvious. If you can't leave, at least change your cirucumstances, and if you can't do that, change yourself. </p> <p> Lately, I've been keeping a small notebook of quotes. Not just any quotes. But quotes that resound with me. I have a few favorites, I'd like to share.</p>  <p><strong><center>"You cannot receive a shock, unless you have an electric affinity for that which shocks you. Have no affinity for what is shocking." ~ Thoreau</strong></center></p>  <p><strong><center>"Hell is empty because all the devils are here." ~ Shakespeare</strong></center></p> <p><strong><center> "The purpose of a writer is to keep civilization from destroying itself." ~ A. Camus</strong></center></p> <p> <strong><center>"My blood is alive with many voices that tell me I am made of longing." ~ Rilke</strong></center></p>  <p><strong><center>"As to conforming outwardly and living your own life inwardly, I don not think much of that." ~ Thoreau</strong></center></p>  <p><strong><center>"Behind every exquisite thing that existed, there was a tragic past." ~ Oscar Wilde</strong></center></p> <p><strong><center> "To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment." ~ Ralph Waldo Emerson</strong></center></p>  <p>The point of sharing these few quotes with you, is that no matter how tragic your circumstances. If you strive bravely, and move forward to change yourself and to be yourself. You just might find out you are exqusite. Something that people see and are amazed by. </p>  <p>Did you know Audrey Hepburn, one of the women, that many of us believe to be beautiful, both inwardly and outwardly. Lived during the time of Nazi occupation in Holland? She helped the Dutch resistance by raising money and carrying messages inside her shoes. Not only that, but she also helped a British paratrooper to safety without the Nazi's finding out. There are countless stories of amazing women who in terrible times stayed true to themselves and held fast despite what others thought. And today, everyone agrees that they were exquisite.</p> <p> That's what I hope to acomplish. Not by deeds, at least not yet. But with the small steps of finding out who I am and staying completely true to it. What I didn't expect was the amount of rejection associated with it. I knew that there was acceptance out there somewhere. But rejection? That was new to me. But then, looking back at women like Hepburn, you think. I bet they were rejected a lot too. If not for their strong wills, character, and ideals, these women would not have been the people we look up to today. They would have just been pretty faces and would have never become the exquisite people we believe them to be today. ... </p> <p> So, the question is, how do you plan to be yourself amid the darkest of days? Eventually, you'll see the light. Until then, be yourself and push on. Your Nerf sword is actually stronger than it appears. Its as strong as you believe yourself to be. ...</p><hr><p><a name="dreamer"></a></p><p><center><h4> <strong><u>Drone or Dreamer? </u></strong></h4></center><p>It seems me and my family have a problem. The world, karma, or something, has other plans for us than the ones we make. I attended college so I could learn Anthropology and Design. I studied the Pyramids, the streets of Paris, and how to draw a drapery. I had hoped to be able to transfer to continue my stuides in Washington state. But now that my brother is extremely disabled, I don't know if it is even possible. What had once been an opportunity has become a gridlock. Doors swing open and they swing shut. We don't always get to peer behind the curtain. </p><p>Things have been shifting in unexpected ways, I'be been killing time in hopes that the door I want will open again. But instead, I came across a quote. <strong>"As if you could kill time without injuring eternity." ~ Henry David Thoreau.</strong> Then I asked myself, Is that what I've been doing? Have I been injuring eternity with my never ending ceaseless battling of will? So, I stopped. I sat. I started listening. I started doing other things. I started questioning. Breaking down everything I thought was stationary and immoveable. Chiseling at it and watching my opinions and assumptions crack and fall, like a thousand crumbling stone bridges. Rebuilding in origami spider's webs. Who, knew that the most fragile of materials, could be so strong? </p><p>I asked myself. Do we need cars? The answer was no. I asked myself. Do we need money? The answer was no. I asked myself if debt was worth an education. The answer was no. Now what? I asked myself. What in the world can you do, without having these things? How can you live without having these things? The answer was to change my perceptions of living. Is living exsisting? Killing time? Consuming? Ever moving forward? It is and it isn't. Living is just being. Its you and your questioning of the world, how you live in it, and what you do. So, what was it that can be done for free? Without any contribution, that allows you to just be and live and do? The answer was, to write. </p><p>Today, I have a cold. My eyes are blurry, but I have never seen clearer. Not everyone can write. Nor should everyone. Every individual has a calling that fits into their ideals. But for me, to write, is the best option available, and one I would love to accept. It fits, like a missing piece in an empty void. I've always loved to write, but it never occured to me that it might be an option, in my financial negative life. I always believed that if I just killed time, pushed a little harder, and made a little money, I could be just like everyone else. Have a family, a job, a house. Then I asked myself. Is that what you want? A nine to five life, where your movements are delegated by the striking of the clock? Until that clock stops and all of eternity was as wasted as your life was? And all has expired?</p><p> No thank you. I'm not a drone, I'm a dreamer. Who lives their life to the fullest? The one who works until their final breathe without accomplishing anything. Or the dreamer who sits under the stars and views the vastness and complexity of everything. Who dreams a million dreams, and lives and million lives. Who has lived more? Obviously the dreamer lived much more and was more wealthy that anyone who worked hard to accumulate things. </p>  <p>So today, as I sit down on the precipice of life, I will ask myself. Am I a drone or a dreamer? Then, I shall pick up my notebook and begin to write. ...</p> <center><h5><strong>"Yes; I am a dreamer.
