About
====
I'm a student, hoping to pursue a double major in Anthropology and Design/Developement. I live in the middle of nowhere in Missouri, moving this summer to Washington state. I don't have a job. But that doesn't mean I don't work. Everyday, I'm either tweaking code, learning something new on the tech scene, or studying.

Currently I'm car-free, but this might change in the future. When it does, be assured it will be something minimalist and eco-friendly. I'm thinking C-1 Lit, by Lit Motors. ...

In the past, I became involved with social innovation, lived in Germany, visited Poland, wrote a book for NaNoWriMo, rescued a dog, and became addicted to programming. I was also invited to study in Cambridge, England and Dimplomacy in China. But lacking the funds, I decided to stay home and code for the time being.

In the future, I hope to delve into the world of Socialstructing, use alternative currencies for at least half of my purchases, become more self-reliant, learn advanced web programming, write & publish an ebook, start running & yoga practice, and become fluent in French.
