<div class="container"><h3>Cut The Filler</h3> <h5>09 Nov 2013 </h5><br>

<p>Have you ever sat next to a person in a coffee shop and have your ears bombarded with so many profanities that you felt they must know the entire dictionary of them? Maybe? How about this then. Your sitting at said coffee shop trying to enjoy your espresso, when out of the blue all of these teenagers rush in talking loudly at the table next to you. Their speech is indecipherable as every other word is either a profanity or the dreaded word 'like'. You begin to cringe as the 'like' count racks up and you rush out of there as fast as possible to escape the chaos. You might even have developed a 'like' habit yourself from overexposure. It happens. ...
</p>
<p>Personally both of these things have happened to me. One day I went to my favorite coffee shop absorbing the atmosphere and Irish music. Then a group of about seven or so people came in talking loudly and spewing out so many profanities I couldn't even count them. And they spewd them for the entire three hours that they were there. 
The other incident was on a local campus when I was sitting in a tech lab working. Someone sitting across from me was talking and every other word was the word 'like'. In a given sentence I counted thirteen of them. 
</p>
<p>So what am I getting at with these explanations? Fillers are bad in all of their forms. Whether swearing, mentally thinking them, or just saying the word 'like' a million times. They cause those around you to become uncomfortable. Not because of the words themselves, but because of the harsh negativity they provoke in the speaker that is then reverberated to the listener. 
</p>
<p>Not only that, but when you use filler words, your speech becomes muddled and unclear to the listener. It causes confusion and makes people no longer want to listen to you. I have even heard people go on to say that people who use filler sound uneducated. Definitely not good, if you are trying to portray yourself as an educated professional. 
</p>
<p>So, what about mental swearing? Same deal my friend. It causes your blood pressure to rise and negative thoughts to multiple, just as if you had spewed those word out into the world, except they are only affecting you. So join me and kick the habit. I'm currently trying to kill mental swearing and the dreaded 'like'. Normally, I use 'like' in my writing and only occasionally in speech. I'd have to say no more that a few times a day. But it's a terrible habit that spreads confusion and negativity and our world doesn't need anymore of that.

<p>P.S. The word 'like' was used eight times in this letter for clarity of the topic.</p>
