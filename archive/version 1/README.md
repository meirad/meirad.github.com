"The Life Stream has gotten a major overhaul if you haven't noticed. From now on and into eternity, it will only show posts for the past week. Then *poof!* they dissapear into a pile of glittery fairy dust."

Index.html is the main page that uses a daily "stream" that is deleted by hand every 7 days.
