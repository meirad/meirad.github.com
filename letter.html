Gwen wrote about faeiries, stardust souls, and what to do if she dies. It struck me, we are all beings that expire, though many of us live our lives in denial and keep searching for immortality. We waste our days. We fumble. We become mired in resistance and mindsmog. Then, when it's our turn to leave this world, we wished we had lived. Because somewhere along the way, we got lost and our lives slipped through the cracks and through our fingers like sand on beach. </p><p>This has only just occured to me, but like Gwen, I've always been wanting to travel. To find peace, to learn new things, to do, and to belong. Maybe carve a place out in the world just for me. Today I realized, we always had that power. It doesn't rely on others, but ourselves. We can carve out a place to belong anywhere and it doesn't require gaining approval of others to get it. </p><p>The only true way to become immortal is to affect the lives of those around you and to live a life that is meaningful and in line with your values. Then, when the time comes for you to leap of the edge. You never truely leave. You just transform and move on to greater things. </p><p>Some day, I might just make it to the edge of the "Great Donut," and like Ev and Gwen, move on to other adventures. When and if I do, here's where will meet. </p><p><center><strong>"Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing there is a field.
