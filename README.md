This is my personal website.

Domain name is forward masked instead of using CNAME attributes with GoDaddy.

"The Life Stream has gotten a major overhaul if you haven't noticed. From now on and into eternity, it will only show posts for the past week. Then *poof!* they dissapear into a pile of glittery fairy dust."

The only part of this website that's copyrighted is the Skeleton.css etc. Currently looking for a replacement to make this website completly uncopyrighted.

This website is based on Bitters by Gwen Bell, but is not an instance of Bitters. It runs both Bitters and Bootstrap. But isn't based on Node.js. In the future I might convert it over to Bitters, if I don't, I'll make it it's own creature. This is a work in progress. 

This website blank slates, all letters can be found in the Archive.  The life stream isn't backed up, 100% blank slate.
