<p>One of the things I like about a new year is the clean slate. We can clean slate everything and have nothing drag on into the new year. Or we can start new things and experiment, dig deep, and discover there are things we love to do that we never would have known about before if we hadn’t taken that leap of faith on January 1st.</p>

<p>One of the things that I found out that I love is untranslatable words. Those feelings that drift on the edges of consciousness that have not a word to solidfy and grasp on to. Words like Wabi Sabi or Gaman in Japanese, that change your entire outlook on life. </p>

<p>Did you know that learning and then speaking in a different language can change your perceptions and personality? Do you know why? It’s those unexplained feeling and emotions that are encompassed by words unexpressable in any other language that do it. It’s the arrangement of the words. It’s the culture that shaped it. They all leave their distilled essence in the one that learns them. … </p>

<p>Here’s some of my favorites for the new year. I hope they expand your horizon’s and maybe change the way you view the world around you too. </p>


Lagom | Swedish – [la-gum] 

	<p>“While it translates into English as “enough” or “just the right amount,” lagom refers to more than just amounts.</p>

	<p>Author Alan Atkisson sees this word as a concept around which Swedish society is organized – one that could help combat the American consumer frenzy.”</p>

Koyaanisqatsi | Hopi – [koy-on-iss-KOT-see] 

	<p>“This Native American word means “nature out of balance” or a “way of life that is so crazy it calls for a new way of living” (Rheingold 243).”</p>

Nehrotit to | 

	<p>“This is a Czech expression that finds use in many situations. Literally, it means “Not to make [the situation] into a sharp point.” Its literal meaning is almost equivalent to a shrug of the shoulders, a declaration that one is not going to stress about something, or, more generally, that one is not going to stress about anything.</p>

	<p>There’s some sort of combination of self-deprecating humour and cynicism implied in the meaning as well. It’s a diffusion of seriousness.”</p>

Sisu |

	<p>“This is a Finnish word which can be approximated with the words “fortitude,” or “grit,” or “perseverance,” or “resolve to overcome obstacles.” It’s another famously untranslatable word that Finns claim to be at some centre of the Finnish national identity.</p>

	<p>Such a word makes some sense for a nation that is completely dark for part of the year, has a native population of reindeer herders, and enjoys a sport that combines skiing long distances with shooting a gun.”</p>

Hygge |

	<p>“Widely said to be central to Danish culture, hygge is often translated into English as “coziness.” However, the connotations reach much deeper than mere coziness can convey. I’ve heard it described as an attention to living life simply and well, to enjoying everyday things like good food, beer, and the company of friends.</p>

	<p>The Xenophobe’s Guide to the Danes has this to say:</p>

	<p><i>Hygge has to do with people’s behavior towards each other. It is the art of creating intimacy: a sense of comradeship, conviviality, and contentment rolled into one.”</i></p>

Saudade | Portuguese 

	<p>“Often brought up in conversations about untranslatability, saudade is a Portuguese word that vaguely means longing or nostalgia for a person one loves, but there are dimensions to this nostalgia that don’t translate outside of the limits of the language. Someone once called it, “vague and constant desire for something that does not and probably cannot exist.”</p>

	<p>I feel that I can approximate understanding in this case, but I cannot feel it wholly. It’s linguistically marvelous to be able to express a specific emotion so succinctly. In Brazil, the day of saudade is celebrated on January 30th.”</p>

Toska | Russian – 

	<p>“Vladmir Nabokov describes it best: “No single word in English renders all the shades of toska. At its deepest and most painful, it is a sensation of great spiritual anguish, often without any specific cause. At less morbid levels it is a dull ache of the soul, a longing with nothing to long for, a sick pining, a vague restlessness, mental throes, yearning. In particular cases it may be the desire for somebody or something specific, nostalgia, love-sickness. At the lowest level it grades into ennui, boredom.” “</p>

Duende | Spanish – 

	<p>“While originally used to describe a mythical, spritelike entity that possesses humans and creates the feeling of awe of one’s surroundings in nature, its meaning has transitioned into referring to “the mysterious power that a work of art has to deeply move a person.” There’s actually a nightclub in the town of La Linea de la Concepcion, where I teach, named after this word. (Altalang.com)”</p>
