  I'm Meira D., I'm a writer, programmer, and yogini in training.  I'm also part of "generation screwed," which makes things complicated. It means, I might not be able to finish college, I don't have a job, and I don't have a car. But what a person in my position does have is a collection of experiences, the drive to learn, and the willingness to adapt to all the crap thrown our way. 
  
    
 In the past, I've attended community college and studied Anthropology. I've also studied Judaism with Rabbi Celso Cukierkorn, practiced disaster rescue with an FBI agent Shalom Shoaf, talked to people on the safety elements possibly required if a hoverboard was to become reality, helped a friend with his autism village in India, became a social innovator, met Jane Goodall, and more.
    
    
That's what this new generation is all about. Since we don't have jobs, we don't dwell on experience necessary. We dwell on experiences collected. I've had a lot of them, and I hope to continue. Yes, actually making money would be nice, but it's not at the top of my list. I've tried the whole get a job thing, repetedly, and you know what? No one is hiring. Even the people that say they are hiring aren't hiring. It's a strange conundrum. ... So, those of us stuck in "generation screwed" have to do something. We have to adapt. 


We're the ones that will eventually set the bar for job and education experience. Can you imagine applying for a job and them asking you how many countries you've been to? Instead of how many years on the job you've had. It's definitely a possibility.
