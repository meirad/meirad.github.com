Nothing's sacred since my imagination tends to kaput when ill. I read everything. Recently, that's been a series of short stories by Jack London. He's one of my favorite author's if you didn't know. As well as, Zen and The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance and every once in a while reading some sections of Thoreau's journal. It's hard to read it on my computer screen. But it's worth every moment for the interesting stuff you come across. Other than that in the past three days I've been rotting my brains out watching television (I don't have Netflix or Cable, straight dvd's). So, I've watched the 3 hour King Kong film with Jack Black, Bewitched, Aliens 4, and the entire second season of Teen Wolf. I've also been debating as the whether I should read Friedrich Nietzsche, and Rebel by Albert Camus. All while digging through deer hunting statistics (for no reason whatsoever) and delving into rereading whatever magazines I have. It's crazy. ...</p><p>So, What's a day in my life like lately? To quell your infinite curiosity. I've settled into two different types of days. One where I'm productive and one where i'm lazy.</p><center><p><h5>Productive Day:</h5></p><p>I wake up and brew tea, eating Greek yogurt and powering up my mac. Double clicking iTunes, I listen to some French songs and podcasts. Then swtich over to music from my playlists. When I feel ready, I open Scrivener and Github app and write, logging my progress to put onto my repo later in the day. Afterwards I take a break for lunch which I usually cook from scratch and write in my journal. After lunch I update my website and write more until evening where I then switch to reading on my ereader.</p></center><center><p><h5>Lazy Day:</h5></p><p>These are web days, research days, knowing and learning days. Usually every other day I have one of these. Keeps the mind busy and relaxed. I log online check my RSS feeds and email, upload all my git progress for my website and writing repo's. Then, I check the news to see what is happening in the world, download articles to read and do my research for my book. That's it. Done.</p></center><p>Later I might read the articles or I'll do something else like mini chores or take Oreo for a walk. But I try to keep the days simple. It's not like that all of the time though, some days I visit my brother and that tends to transform the whole day into a traveling lazy day. Where I try to fit in a little bit of research with a lot of visiting and poster making.</p><p>[ <strong>My brother loves to make art requests. He tells me a favorite Disney or cartoon character and I sketch and color him on newsprint with oil pastels. He then works on his own poster while waiting for me to finish and then we hang them on his wall. Each poster takes between 30 minutes and 3 hours.</strong>]</p><p>That's a little bit about me. You wanna make my day? Give me the title of an obsure Jack London novel. I promise to look it up and read it. :) So far, I've read: "To Build A Fire," "Trust," "Call of the Wild," & "Lost Face."</p><hr><p><a name="#writing"></a></p><p><center><h4>Writing & Life Updates</h4></center><br><p> I've always wondered what it was like to be a writer. Every time I see one in a movie, whether it's Jewel of the Nile or Nim's Island. The author's always seems strange, she's either drunk, bedazzled by thoughts of romance, or locked in her house terrified to go outside or all three in one. I've never thought of myself that way. </p><p>True, I do spend a lot of time at home, but I don't drink and I definitely don't choke up during scenes in my book. I probably should, maybe there's something on the emotional level that makes a book live. I don't know. But usually, I'm sitting at home drinking tea and cursing the sunlight filtering through the window while I try to channel my darker side and occasionally give my dog a belly rub. If i'm not doing that, i'm surfing the web learning things, walking my dog and attempting to avoid any and all people in the area. It's not that I don't like people, it's that they annoy me. They smile when they don't mean it, they talk just to hear themselves, not allowing anyone else into the conversation. And usually, well, when they do let you in on a conversation, let's just say it's about topics I'd rather not hear or even know about. </p><p>I prefer the company of introverted people. Those who listen, then speak. Those who question instead of assume that's the way things are. The people who wonder, imagine, spark, and ignite, create and do. Genuine people. Artists. Writers who have not been constricted in their views of the world but see the grande scheme of things. Those are the people that make a difference and when they speak, you listen. Not because you have to or you'll seem rude. But because you can't stop listening the mingling of their words with what you yourself have been feeling or thinking all along. That's real. And when they smile at you or give you a scowl, it's a genuine reflection of what they feel at the moment. No false facades, no alterior motives. Just the truth. Plain and simple.</p><p> I suppose I should give an update on my poetry. I guess this is a catch all post. My first poem was rejected by Poetry Magazine. I'm not in the least bit surprise or angry. I didn't receive one of those scarring rejection letters that haunt writers souls, but a neat and respectible one. I've heard that being rejected by Poetry Magazine is a right of passage among writers and the fact that they rejected it in as nice and professional manner as possible, gives me the confidence to keep on writing. I've heard tales where writers were asked never to submit their writing again until they became better etc. And other such horror stores from the Magazine.  So, I was actually relieved when I received mine. I cannot but hope to continue to write better in an attempt to not only gain publishment, but also to perfect it. It will take time, but I hope to submit another poem within the year. </p><p> On to tales of the not so writing kind. My brother is supposed to come home soon. Which means, my writng will stagger considerably. For some strange reason, being around other people stops my writing in its tracks. But, the good news is that my family will all be together again soon. So far we have been scattered across a stretch of fifty or sixty miles in distance between each other, all locked in separate worlds of horror. My mother worrying that my brothers autistic fits will get him taken away. My brother throwing fits because he hasn't been home in over two months. My dad wondering what the heck to do and bouncing back and forth. My sister with a cold and attempting to write a story while comforting our brother. All of this while money stops flowing, the viruses start spreading, lies get told, people panic, and others are just afraid. It's enough to drive anyone mad. </p><p>Today I learned how to encrypt a flash drive for storing my writing in a secure as possible way, in addition to my repo on GitHub. I also, learned that it costs $3.75 to send an envelope of letters to Germany from here if you have the unfortunate luck of the envelope being considered "rigid". Not to mention the possibility of it costing upwards of $5-$15 dollars and possibly filling out customs paperwork. It was definitely a headache, that's for sure. </p><p>Hmm. On top of this, I'm behind on the news. Has anything happened of interest? The last I saw of the news online it seemed Hollywood marriages and separations were more important than finding out what was actually happening in the world. It makes me nauseous thinking about how far we've fallen news wise. </p><p>Also, I'm limiting my web prescence.  If you do a search for me the websites will all be dead. I'm shutting them all down. Only this website will remain. The last thing a writer wants is to be plagued with mass messages from social networks. They are just a distraction from what should be done. I wouldn't click the contact button. I won't receive your messages as I'm switching providers. I will let you know when it's back up though and may provide a temporary service in the meantime. </p><p>P.S. Any reasons you can think of that a single bat would screech and attack a person? Apparently this happened right outside of my house to my sister a few days ago. It rammed into her arm and then flew through her hair. Thankfully there were no bite or scratch marks visible. <hr><p><a name="seasons"></a></p><p><center><h4>Changing of the Seasons</h4></center><br><p>A lot has been changing. The weather swishes back and forth between the depths of summer heat and the beauty of a light and cool autumn. My personality is as moody as the weather. … For a long time now, I've felt that someone handed me a foam Nerf sword to battle dragons. The dragons were those of poverty, health collapses in my family, and the struggle to find who I am in comparison to who people want me to be or who they think I should be.</p><p> It's a struggle. ... I live in the middle of nowhere. A small town encompassed by fields of yellowed corn. They were black last year, the summer heat scorched them dry. ... I live in the country, where people drink beer and talk big about winning the powerball, because all opportunity has been sapped, leaving them broken. I was almost one of them. ... Not the drinking part, but the broken part.  I'm still struggling, but I'm getting better. Things change, like the shifting of the seasons, and sometimes change is good. </p> <p> For me it's involved a lot of decisions. Do I listen to what people say around me? About me? How they drag my family name into the dirt out of spite? Do I listen to the dramatic whispers of the church goers? Or do I forge my own path? The answer has been obvious. If you can't leave, at least change your cirucumstances, and if you can't do that, change yourself. </p> <p> Lately, I've been keeping a small notebook of quotes. Not just any quotes. But quotes that resound with me. I have a few favorites, I'd like to share.</p>  <p><strong><center>"You cannot receive a shock, unless you have an electric affinity for that which shocks you. Have no affinity for what is shocking." ~ Thoreau</strong></center></p>  <p><strong><center>"Hell is empty because all the devils are here." ~ Shakespeare</strong></center></p> <p><strong><center> "The purpose of a writer is to keep civilization from destroying itself." ~ A. Camus</strong></center></p> <p> <strong><center>"My blood is alive with many voices that tell me I am made of longing." ~ Rilke</strong></center></p>  <p><strong><center>"As to conforming outwardly and living your own life inwardly, I don not think much of that." ~ Thoreau</strong></center></p>  <p><strong><center>"Behind every exquisite thing that existed, there was a tragic past." ~ Oscar Wilde</strong></center></p> <p><strong><center> "To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment." ~ Ralph Waldo Emerson</strong></center></p>  <p>The point of sharing these few quotes with you, is that no matter how tragic your circumstances. If you strive bravely, and move forward to change yourself and to be yourself. You just might find out you are exqusite. Something that people see and are amazed by. </p>  <p>Did you know Audrey Hepburn, one of the women, that many of us believe to be beautiful, both inwardly and outwardly. Lived during the time of Nazi occupation in Holland? She helped the Dutch resistance by raising money and carrying messages inside her shoes. Not only that, but she also helped a British paratrooper to safety without the Nazi's finding out. There are countless stories of amazing women who in terrible times stayed true to themselves and held fast despite what others thought. And today, everyone agrees that they were exquisite.</p> <p> That's what I hope to acomplish. Not by deeds, at least not yet. But with the small steps of finding out who I am and staying completely true to it. What I didn't expect was the amount of rejection associated with it. I knew that there was acceptance out there somewhere. But rejection? That was new to me. But then, looking back at women like Hepburn, you think. I bet they were rejected a lot too. If not for their strong wills, character, and ideals, these women would not have been the people we look up to today. They would have just been pretty faces and would have never become the exquisite people we believe them to be today. ... </p> <p> So, the question is, how do you plan to be yourself amid the darkest of days? Eventually, you'll see the light. Until then, be yourself and push on. Your Nerf sword is actually stronger than it appears. Its as strong as you believe yourself to be. ...</p><hr><p><a name="dreamer"></a></p><p><center><h4>Drone or Dreamer?</h4></center><p>It seems me and my family have a problem. The world, karma, or something, has other plans for us than the ones we make. I attended college so I could learn Anthropology and Design. I studied the Pyramids, the streets of Paris, and how to draw a drapery. I had hoped to be able to transfer to continue my stuides in Washington state. But now that my brother is extremely disabled, I don't know if it is even possible. What had once been an opportunity has become a gridlock. Doors swing open and they swing shut. We don't always get to peer behind the curtain. </p><p>Things have been shifting in unexpected ways, I'be been killing time in hopes that the door I want will open again. But instead, I came across a quote. <strong>"As if you could kill time without injuring eternity." ~ Henry David Thoreau.</strong> Then I asked myself, Is that what I've been doing? Have I been injuring eternity with my never ending ceaseless battling of will? So, I stopped. I sat. I started listening. I started doing other things. I started questioning. Breaking down everything I thought was stationary and immoveable. Chiseling at it and watching my opinions and assumptions crack and fall, like a thousand crumbling stone bridges. Rebuilding in origami spider's webs. Who, knew that the most fragile of materials, could be so strong? </p><p>I asked myself. Do we need cars? The answer was no. I asked myself. Do we need money? The answer was no. I asked myself if debt was worth an education. The answer was no. Now what? I asked myself. What in the world can you do, without having these things? How can you live without having these things? The answer was to change my perceptions of living. Is living exsisting? Killing time? Consuming? Ever moving forward? It is and it isn't. Living is just being. Its you and your questioning of the world, how you live in it, and what you do. So, what was it that can be done for free? Without any contribution, that allows you to just be and live and do? The answer was, to write. </p><p>Today, I have a cold. My eyes are blurry, but I have never seen clearer. Not everyone can write. Nor should everyone. Every individual has a calling that fits into their ideals. But for me, to write, is the best option available, and one I would love to accept. It fits, like a missing piece in an empty void. I've always loved to write, but it never occured to me that it might be an option, in my financial negative life. I always believed that if I just killed time, pushed a little harder, and made a little money, I could be just like everyone else. Have a family, a job, a house. Then I asked myself. Is that what you want? A nine to five life, where your movements are delegated by the striking of the clock? Until that clock stops and all of eternity was as wasted as your life was? And all has expired?</p><p> No thank you. I'm not a drone, I'm a dreamer. Who lives their life to the fullest? The one who works until their final breathe without accomplishing anything. Or the dreamer who sits under the stars and views the vastness and complexity of everything. Who dreams a million dreams, and lives and million lives. Who has lived more? Obviously the dreamer lived much more and was more wealthy that anyone who worked hard to accumulate things. </p>  <p>So today, as I sit down on the precipice of life, I will ask myself. Am I a drone or a dreamer? Then, I shall pick up my notebook and begin to write. ...</p> <center><h5><strong>"Yes; I am a dreamer. For a dreamer is one who can only find his way by moonlight, and his punishment is that he sees the dawn before the rest of the world." ~ Oscar Wilde</strong></h5></center><hr><p><a name="review"></a></p><p><center><h4>Review of: "Haiku for Lover's Anthology of Love and Lust</h4></center></p><p>I was a little iffy on reviewing this anthology. It wasn't what I thought it would be, that's for sure. Intertwined with ligh haiku's about love, which are sweet, there were a lot of distasteful haiku's. The photography varied from like rememberings of first loves, to something that was more akin to photoshoped porn. I'm extremely divided on this book to say the least. There's a lot of just plain terrible things in there. But then, just when you think it's a total loss, there are a few redeeming poems. Some of those poems remind me of long lost love letters. While the others are disturbing. Perhaps it has to do with the compiler of this anthology being a sex columnist in the past, I don't know. But I'm more of a person who loves wistfully romantic love poems, than well, the other stuff. ...</p><hr><p><a name="life"></a></p>    <p><center><h4>Life Refashioned</h4></center></p><p>If I didn't tell you before, I've been reading Darling Magazine's website. To the point of knowing what every single past article has said. I've read their entire archive. I tend to do strange things like that when I relate to something ( it almost never happens). But why am I telling you this? Well, I'm pretty sure I'm on the edge, of not just a lifestyle change, but a change also in my point of view. It's strange and a little scary. ... But for every article I've been reading and for every old book I've been attempting to find a read, there's been a shift in my reality.</p><p>I think there's a little bit of fear involved every time we experience one of those shifts. It's almost like feeling the floor falling out beneath you, but knowing you are going to bounce back up. Instead of being terrified you know it is there, but you also still have the feeling of falling that scares you half to death.</p><p>So, here's where I am today. I'm ok without the internet. I log on, check my messages, download articles to read, upload my web posts and that's it. Sometimes I'll search for a book or something for my e-reader but only if I know what I'm looking for. I've cut down my time to about 15 minutes every other day. Except on days where I'm looking for a certain book. </p><p>I have an addiction forming for strange normally unused archaic words and letter writing. My poetry is improving. I've started collecting inspirational unheard of quotes. I'm reading older and longer books ( there are things longer than Harry Potter out there that are not legalese). Everything from Rilke to Thoreau's 2 million + words journal. I'm starting to hate soda and only drink it when I don't have another choice. I love mixing fruit juices with Perrier or having hot tea with cream. I have a growing addiction to drawing with oil pastels ( not sure how that happened ). </p><p>I'm addicted to Picadilly notebooks ( the extremely cheap cousin of moleskins ). I want to deck out my cruiser bicycle and use it for my main form of transport for short distances. I have no urge to purchase a car. The thought that there isn't a bakery nearby has compelled me to learn how to make english muffins, biscuits, focaccia, and ciabatta from scratch. The lack of desserts that weren't in a box has caused me to learn how to make pies, Cranberry Apple Tort, Icelandic Christmas Cake, and numerous types of cookies.</p><p> I don't like to shop new if I can help it. I've bought Italian silver goblets, a marble cutting board, ceramic Chinese bowls, a Japanese jewelry box, and a handmade bird cage; all second hand. I look for books that are out of print. I became a poetry snob. I write all of the time. These are just a few of the changes I've noticed.</p>  <p> I think I've started to also invest in small experiences without knowing to. Such as, sitting at the Irish Coffee Shop for hours on end listening to the Irish reels and songs. As well as, getting a beautiful French easel, which I cannot wait to use for hours on end. These things once they start seem to keep bouncing off each other and creating more and new changes in my life. It's like I flipped the first domino and the chain of living a real life started hitting me in stages. And honestly, I'm curious about what's next in line. ...</p><br><hr><p><a name="rightnow"></a></p>    <p><center><h4>Right Now</h4></center></p><p>Right now I'm crashed out my parents couch with a headache. I think I got too dehydrated and hot today from being caught in traffic on the highway. Anyway, I just wanted to take this small moment in my agony to tell you about what's been happening. </p><p>I've changed a lot in past two weeks. My entire perspective on life and how we are supposed to live is being rewritten every day. </p><p>I've been searching forever for how to live what I believe in, to be inline with those values, that are so intrisically apart of who I am. I think I found it. After reading the "Dial Letters" by Emerson and Thoreau, as well as working through the second half of "Walden, " I realized that we live on the web way too much. </p><p>We use apps that are actually useless in the long run because they are designed for non-stop connectivity to the computer. Since my brain and probably yours too, isn't connected to the computer via wireless connection at all times. What's the point? There isn't a need to be online all the time to have a budget, or to log on to get your task list for the day, or even to check your calendar. So why do we? Why do we constantly log on? Constantly edit that list because it isn't analog or keep logging on to check our messages? I think it's because, we forgot there was a better way. ...</p><p>So, my plan is to get a few beautiful moleskins and some stationary. I plan to write my task list by hand, following the ZTD method by Leo Babauta. My schedule will be in the style of Benjamin Franklin. My budget will be vaules based. But what does this mean?</p><p>Value based budgeting is a beautiful mixture of minimalism, Benjamin Franklin's vaule chart, an idea hot bed, budget, and project list. Basically, you start out with a normal budget, income, fixed, discretionary. Then, you get another page and write out three vaules that resound with you financially. Then, you brainstorm. </p><p>Think of all the ways that you can live these pricipals. If you chose something like Health or Happiness as a value. You can make your own lunch sack or buy only from the farmers market. If you chose something like Independence, go debt free. Start writing letters snail mail style, save for your dream vacation etc. They are your's for the taking and living. That's what it's all about anyway; getting away from that screen your eyes are glued to and living.</p><p>If you do this, you have time for so much more in your life. Here's an example. I never get up at 6:40 am I'm a 10:00 am person. But today at HavenHouse I woke at 6:40 am. Here's what I got done before 10:00 am:</p><ul><li>Breakfast</li><li>Brush Teeth</li><li>Shower</li><li>Pack for leaving</li><li>Charge Ipad</li><li>Cook</li><li>Pack lunch</li><li>Take a nap</li><li>Read some articles</li></ul><p>That's a lot of stuff, I normally would have slept through. I failed to mention that I stared for about ten minutes watching a strange squirrel roll in the grass and watched the fog roll in. All things I would have hated to miss. </p><br><hr><p><a name="poetry"></a></p>    <p><center><h4>Poetry Submital & Haven House</h4></center></p><p>It's my second day here at HavenHouse. A non-profit which acts a lot like a hotel. It's almost like living in a boarding house. Every day you wake up and walk out of your hotel-esque room to a dining hall, where food is served for free to the residents. All of which, are families with someone who is at one of the local hospitals. It's interesting. We operate like a small community. There are rooms for watching tv, small kitchens, and laundry rooms, which everyone rushes to get to before they are full. There is even free shuttle service to the local hospitals. So, far we have met people that live but three miles from where we do, all the way to Texas. It's all been very interesting.</p><p>Also, I submitted my first poem to a magazine. I'm hoping for good news, but you never know. If they send me a mass generic rejection letter, no hard feelings, I need the constructive critisism to further my craft. There are few different literary magazines out there I hope to publish to in the future.</p> <p>But for those who think you might make a lot of money doing it; you don't. If you are among the top 1% you may make $10 dollars a line. You don't become a poet or a writer for the money. You become a poet and a writer because you couldn't think of being anything else. So, that's pretty much all of an update I can give right now. In the next 6-8 weeks while I'm waiting on word for my first poem, I'm going to be writing a few more. They may be good, they may be crap. But the important thing is to keep writing. </p><hr>   <p><a name="detox"></a></p>    <p><center><h4>Life Detox</h4></center></p><p>I'm detoxing my life. It's been a long process of figuring out what needs to be gotten rid of and how to change my life for the better. But I think I finally have an idea about how to do it. Most of what I write for you to read online isn't anything like how I write for myself in my journal. Usually I'm writing about tech, security, or some other very light topic. My reality is a lot different. </p><p>Usually, I sit and think for a lot of the day. I contemplate. This past week it's been on wisdom, the environment, why we only skitter across the top of an idea but never really work it into thought, blank slating, detoxing, what really matters in our short lives and how to be truely present in that time frame. It's a lot to think about. But I have hours sitting in a hospital bedside, by my brother, to contemplate them. </p><p>Here's some things that aren't important to me anymore:</p><ul><li>+ <strong>A job</strong> ( meaningless, soul sucking, corporation, or mindless inducing.)</li><li>+ <strong>Worry</strong> ( it takes away from what's happening in that moment, so you are not their for yourself or others.)</li><li>+ <strong>Lots of stuff</strong> ( Although I won't be ready for the 100 things challenge, I definitely don't see a reason to continue being a constant consumer and will be shearing a lot of my crap.)</li><li>+ <strong>Fear</strong> (You can be afraid and worry to your hearts content. But it is only a block to keep you from doing what you need to be doing.)</li><li>+ <strong>How other people think I should be.</strong> ( Don't let other people form your opinion of yourself, and don't let them mold you into one of the masses, you are a unique person, stay that way.)</li><li>+ <strong>Reading abridged books</strong> which were supposedly only for children, but have sneaked into adult reading. That's right, we all read on a highschool level, that is unless you started reading unabridged classics (Good luck finding them). </li></strong></ul><p>So, I'm detoxing. Detoxing away from the crap that fills our lives to the brim. Detoxing from worry and fear. I've cut down my time on the web. I've cut down my time on the computer. They both take away from who we are in a way.</p><p>I've started experimenting with living a deeper life. Part of this has resulted in a planning stage. I'm currently taking apart Benjamin Franklins old DIY GTD system and converting it into a modern equivalent. I'm reading Thoreau, not just Walden, but his letters and journals. Thoreau thought deep thoughts, he absorbed what was around him and was mindful about everything. He was a great intellectual. So, that's where I'm starting. Then, I will read other people's works. </p><p>I've also started writing again. Really writing. Not that light stuff that skims the surface of our thought processes but the deep stuff. It's a lot harder to do, but the payoff is immense. I'm not sure how far I'm going to go with this experiment in deeper living, It won't be to the point of a shack in the woods, I'm too terrified of the mountain lions for that. But it will be an experiment with a lot of steps and challenges. It will involve getting rid of things, acquiring a few things, simplifying, and a lot of experimentation. So, as I begin my journey, I would like to pose a question. Would you take the challenge?</p></h5></blockquote><hr>   <p><a name="reading"></a></p>    <p><center><h4>Reading Now</h4></center></p><p>I've been reading a ton lately, while busy shuttling back and forth to the hospital to visit my brother. So, I thought I would include a small running list here. Just until my brother recovers. It's been a really rough time and I don't feel like I should talk about it just yet, so in the meantime, there is the list.</p><ul><li> Poems by Robert Frost</li><li>Rilke's Letter's to a Young Poet</li><li>August Rodin by Rilke</li><li>Thoreau's letters to Emerson</li></ul><p>P.S. Lately me any my sister have been extremely bored on the 55+ mile drive one way to the hospital, so we've been working on numerous lists. One of them being the best multi-inventors, another for great muscians etc. When we are finished, I'll post them. *Hint: Tesla made the list.</p><hr> <br><h4>P.S.</h4> <div class="mark"> <p>  If you are looking for a past letter.
