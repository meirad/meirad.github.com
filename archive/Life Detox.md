I'm detoxing my life. It's been a long process of figuring out what needs to be gotten rid of and how to change my life for the better. But I think I finally have an idea about how to do it. Most of what I write for you to read online isn't anything like how I write for myself in my journal. Usually I'm writing about tech, security, or some other very light topic. My reality is a lot different. 

Usually, I sit and think for a lot of the day. I contemplate. This past week it's been on wisdom, the environment, why we only skitter across the top of an idea but never really work it into thought, blank slating, detoxing, what really matters in our short lives and how to be truely present in that time frame. It's a lot to think about. But I have hours sitting in a hospital bedside, by my brother, to contemplate them. 

Here's some things that aren't important to me anymore:

- A job ( meaningless, soul sucking, corporation, or mindless inducing.)
- Worry ( it takes away from what's happening in that moment, so you are not their for yourself or others.)
- Lots of stuff ( Although I won't be ready for the 100 things challenge, I definitely don't see a reason to continue being a constant consumer and will be shearing a lot of my crap.)
- Fear (You can be afraid and worry to your hearts content. But it is only a block to keep you from doing what you need to be doing.)
- How other people think I should be. ( Don't let other people form your opinion of yourself, and don't let them mold you into one of the masses, you are a unique person, stay that way.)
- Reading abridged books which were supposedly only for children, but have sneaked into adult reading. That's right, we all read on a highschool level, that is unless you started reading unabridged classics (Good luck finding them). 

So, I'm detoxing. Detoxing away from the crap that fills our lives to the brim. Detoxing from worry and fear. I've cut down my time on the web. I've cut down my time on the computer. They both take away from who we are in a way.

I've started experimenting with living a deeper life. Part of this has resulted in a planning stage. I'm currently taking apart Benjamin Franklins old DIY GTD system and converting it into a modern equivalent. I'm reading Thoreau, not just Walden, but his letters and journals. Thoreau thought deep thoughts, he absorbed what was around him and was mindful about everything. He was a great intellectual. So, that's where I'm starting. Then, I will read other people's works. 

I've also started writing again. Really writing. Not that light stuff that skims the surface of our thought processes but the deep stuff. It's a lot harder to do, but the payoff is immense. I'm not sure how far I'm going to go with this experiment in deeper living, It won't be to the point of a shack in the woods, I'm too terrified of the mountain lions for that. But it will be an experiment with a lot of steps and challenges. It will involve getting rid of things, acquiring a few things, simplifying, and a lot of experimentation. So, as I begin my journey, I would like to pose a question. Would you take the challenge?
