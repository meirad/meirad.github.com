	<p><center><h4><strong><u>Security & Tech</u></strong></h4></center></p>
<p>Mission 2 is all about diving into the deep end, sifting through the zero's and one's that make up a computer, knowing the code. What is it that makes up this matrix? Where does cryptography come in? Why is security important today, not just on a commercial level but a personal level? What the heck is Node, Git, Python and all of these other weird and wild things people speak about on the web? Well. I'm going to find out. ...</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Command Line</li>
		<li>Git</li>
		<li>Github</li>
		<li>Packets</li>
		<li>DOM</li>	
		<li>JavaScript</li>	
		<li>Node.js</li>
		<li>Python</li>	
		<li>PGP</li>
		<li>CJDNS</li>
		<li>Raspberry Pi</li>
		<li>Servers</li>
		<li>Bitters</li>
		<li>Linux (Arch, Ubuntu)</li>
		<li>VIM</li>
		<li>Email in's and out's</li>
		<li>SSH</li>
	</ul>
		<p>I've dabbled in a lot of this in the past. Like a tourist in a foreign country not knowing the language, I stumbled trying to speak like the natives and gave up. I've heard a lot about how important all of this is and I feel like a Windows user getting my first computer all over again. Confused. Thinking I knew everything there was to know and finding out that I was still a newb while the techies laughed at how ill prepared I was on their fancy macbook pro's. Well, I am now a mac person and apparently a newb all over again. Once I learned the new operating system I found that it was no longer the beautiful free os I had thought it was. There's quirks in the code. So, now that I know two different operating systems, the techies are laughing because they have their arch boxes.</p>
		<p>Not wanting to feel foolish and realizing just how unintelligent I am. (An important step to progress in anything.) I created the above list with the attempt to become a knowledgable techie ninja. So, this is the beginning. I've tossed out BBEdit, TextTastic and all the other editors out there. I'm on MacVim and I'm staying. I'm downloading articles from universities and reading up on Packets, DOM, etc. Anything and everything, stretching the boundaries, and making sure I actually learn something while I'm away from college. At this point I don't really care how annoying it is or difficult, I've got a lot of time to learn. ... </p>

	<p><center><h4><strong><u>Bicycle Mechanics</u></strong></h4></center></p>
		<p>As you know, I've been working on becoming more self reliant this year. Unfortunately, I have had absolutely no idea what that entails. So, I've decided to do it by blending past and present together to create a set of missions or goals to hit. The first of these goals, inspired by <a href="https://www.diy.org">DIY.org</a> is <strong>Bicycle Mechanic</strong>. </p>
		<p>The coming weeks will be dedicated to tool aquisition and the building of a tool kit. According to DIY's website a small list of materials should include the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strike>Adjustable Wrench</strike></li>
			<li>Cone Wrench</li>
			<li><strike>Philips Screwdriver</strike></li>
			<li>Cable Cutters</li>
			<li>Crank Puller</li>
			<li>Repair Stand</li>
			<li>Chain Tool</li>
			<li>Metrix Hex Keys</li>
			<li>Spoke Wrench</li>
			<li>Chain Whip</li>
			<li>Patch Kit</li>
			<li>Tire Levers</li>
		</ul>
		<p>It's a good starting list, that's for sure. But if you're like me and bought an awesome bicycle that's been stripped down past the necessities. There's some things you gotta add to this list. </p>
		<ul>
			<li> oil</li>
			<li>Steel Scrubber</li>
			<li>WD-40</li>
			<li>Bell</li>
			<li>Tire Inner Tubes</li>
			<li>Lights</li>
			<li>Glue</li>
			<li>Basket or paniers</li>
			<li>Caps for tires</li>
			<li>Water bottle holder & Steel Water bottle</li>
			<li>Bike fenders</li>
		</ul>
		<p> The oil and steel scrubber are excellent for getting rid of any and all rust on your bicycle in just moments. WD-40 is kind of self explanatory. The inner tubes? Well, you cannot have enough of them if you live in a rural area where it can take 40+ minutes to find a shop that may or may not sell extra's. Caps tend to disappear when needed most and your handle bars are sure to fall off, or if made of rubber rot in hot temperatures. The rest is just convience and safety options that should have come with your bicycle. If they didn't, then you better get'em.</p>

		<p>I think when these two lists are combined, you've got pretty much everything covered except a bike seat, brakes and a backup chain, to rebuild your entire bike and possibly trick it out a little. I would also suggest a tape measure, for seeing what size tires are required for your bike as well.</p>

		<p> Now that I've covered all of that, you might think I'm already a bicycle mechanic. Well, I'm not. I don't know any of the tools of the trade and although somewhat technically inclined, it's going to be an interesting mission that's for sure. So, I'll leave this letter at that. It's time to go dig up some tools. ...</p>

	<p><center><h4><strong><u>Football</u></strong></h4></center></p>
		<p>So, football. Not my sport. It's not that I don't get the game. I do, but I honestly don't see the point. Everythings expensive, very consumerist. I mean my soda was $9.95, I'm just grateful I had a free drink & hot dog pass. As for the game itself? I was in row UU, the nosebleed section, and what I saw was not worth the $48 dollars. Did you know during commercials they just stop playing? Everyone's drunk, everyone's screaming, some people are paling out from the heights and the players are just taking another break after playing for a minute and a half. I prefer baseball, soccer, lacrosse, these are real games. Full of sweat, blood, broken bones and glory. Football? Not so much. ... </p>
		
		<p>The upside? I saw some amazing sculptures on the riverfront, discovered a wax museum (Iron Man, Nosferatu, Raptors, the Joker), walked down cobblestone paths and saw three horse carriages. Which sort of made me wonder. Are St.Louis horses under the same unhealthy living conditions as in New York? </p>

	<p><center><h4><strong><u>A Sick Writer Reads. ... </u></strong></h4></center></p>
		<p>I've been reading a lot lately to recuperate from a cold. Nothing's sacred since my imagination tends to kaput when ill. I read everything. Recently, that's been a series of short stories by Jack London. He's one of my favorite author's if you didn't know. As well as, Zen and The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance and every once in a while reading some sections of Thoreau's journal. It's hard to read it on my computer screen. But it's worth every moment for the interesting stuff you come across. Other than that in the past three days I've been rotting my brains out watching television (I don't have Netflix or Cable, straight dvd's). So, I've watched the 3 hour King Kong film with Jack Black, Bewitched, Aliens 4, and the entire second season of Teen Wolf. I've also been debating as the whether I should read Friedrich Nietzsche, and Rebel by Albert Camus. All while digging through deer hunting statistics (for no reason whatsoever) and delving into rereading whatever magazines I have. It's crazy. ...</p>
		<p>So, What's a day in my life like lately? To quell your infinite curiosity. I've settled into two different types of days. One where I'm productive and one where i'm lazy.</p>
		<center><p><h5>Productive Day:</h5></p>
		<p>I wake up and brew tea, eating Greek yogurt and powering up my mac. Double clicking iTunes, I listen to some French songs and podcasts. Then swtich over to music from my playlists. When I feel ready, I open Scrivener and Github app and write, logging my progress to put onto my repo later in the day. Afterwards I take a break for lunch which I usually cook from scratch and write in my journal. After lunch I update my website and write more until evening where I then switch to reading on my ereader.</p></center>
		<center><p><h5>Lazy Day:</h5></p>
		<p>These are web days, research days, knowing and learning days. Usually every other day I have one of these. Keeps the mind busy and relaxed. I log online check my RSS feeds and email, upload all my git progress for my website and writing repo's. Then, I check the news to see what is happening in the world, download articles to read and do my research for my book. That's it. Done.</p></center>

		<p>Later I might read the articles or I'll do something else like mini chores or take Oreo for a walk. But I try to keep the days simple. It's not like that all of the time though, some days I visit my brother and that tends to transform the whole day into a traveling lazy day. Where I try to fit in a little bit of research with a lot of visiting and poster making.</p>

		<p>[ <strong>My brother loves to make art requests. He tells me a favorite Disney or cartoon character and I sketch and color him on newsprint with oil pastels. He then works on his own poster while waiting for me to finish and then we hang them on his wall. Each poster takes between 30 minutes and 3 hours.</strong>]</p>

		<p>That's a little bit about me. You wanna make my day? Give me the title of an obsure Jack London novel. I promise to look it up and read it. :) So far, I've read: "To Build A Fire," "Trust," "Call of the Wild," & "Lost Face."</p>

	<p><center><h4> <strong><u>Writing & Life Updates </u></strong></h4></center>
<br>
		<p> I've always wondered what it was like to be a writer. Every time I see one in a movie, whether it's Jewel of the Nile or Nim's Island. The author's always seems strange, she's either drunk, bedazzled by thoughts of romance, or locked in her house terrified to go outside or all three in one. I've never thought of myself that way. </p>

		<p>True, I do spend a lot of time at home, but I don't drink and I definitely don't choke up during scenes in my book. I probably should, maybe there's something on the emotional level that makes a book live. I don't know. But usually, I'm sitting at home drinking tea and cursing the sunlight filtering through the window while I try to channel my darker side and occasionally give my dog a belly rub. If i'm not doing that, i'm surfing the web learning things, walking my dog and attempting to avoid any and all people in the area. It's not that I don't like people, it's that they annoy me. They smile when they don't mean it, they talk just to hear themselves, not allowing anyone else into the conversation. And usually, well, when they do let you in on a conversation, let's just say it's about topics I'd rather not hear or even know about. </p>

		<p>I prefer the company of introverted people. Those who listen, then speak. Those who question instead of assume that's the way things are. The people who wonder, imagine, spark, and ignite, create and do. Genuine people. Artists. Writers who have not been constricted in their views of the world but see the grande scheme of things. Those are the people that make a difference and when they speak, you listen. Not because you have to or you'll seem rude. But because you can't stop listening the mingling of their words with what you yourself have been feeling or thinking all along. That's real. And when they smile at you or give you a scowl, it's a genuine reflection of what they feel at the moment. No false facades, no alterior motives. Just the truth. Plain and simple.</p>

		<p> I suppose I should give an update on my poetry. I guess this is a catch all post. My first poem was rejected by Poetry Magazine. I'm not in the least bit surprise or angry. I didn't receive one of those scarring rejection letters that haunt writers souls, but a neat and respectible one. I've heard that being rejected by Poetry Magazine is a right of passage among writers and the fact that they rejected it in as nice and professional manner as possible, gives me the confidence to keep on writing. I've heard tales where writers were asked never to submit their writing again until they became better etc. And other such horror stores from the Magazine.  So, I was actually relieved when I received mine. I cannot but hope to continue to write better in an attempt to not only gain publishment, but also to perfect it. It will take time, but I hope to submit another poem within the year. </p>
		<p> On to tales of the not so writing kind. My brother is supposed to come home soon. Which means, my writng will stagger considerably. For some strange reason, being around other people stops my writing in its tracks. But, the good news is that my family will all be together again soon. So far we have been scattered across a stretch of fifty or sixty miles in distance between each other, all locked in separate worlds of horror. My mother worrying that my brothers autistic fits will get him taken away. My brother throwing fits because he hasn't been home in over two months. My dad wondering what the heck to do and bouncing back and forth. My sister with a cold and attempting to write a story while comforting our brother. All of this while money stops flowing, the viruses start spreading, lies get told, people panic, and others are just afraid. It's enough to drive anyone mad. </p>
		<p>Today I learned how to encrypt a flash drive for storing my writing in a secure as possible way, in addition to my repo on GitHub. I also, learned that it costs $3.75 to send an envelope of letters to Germany from here if you have the unfortunate luck of the envelope being considered "rigid". Not to mention the possibility of it costing upwards of $5-$15 dollars and possibly filling out customs paperwork. It was definitely a headache, that's for sure. </p>

		<p>Hmm. On top of this, I'm behind on the news. Has anything happened of interest? The last I saw of the news online it seemed Hollywood marriages and separations were more important than finding out what was actually happening in the world. It makes me nauseous thinking about how far we've fallen news wise. </p>

		<p>Also, I'm limiting my web prescence.  If you do a search for me the websites will all be dead. I'm shutting them all down. Only this website will remain. The last thing a writer wants is to be plagued with mass messages from social networks. They are just a distraction from what should be done. I wouldn't click the contact button. I won't receive your messages as I'm switching providers. I will let you know when it's back up though and may provide a temporary service in the meantime. </p>
		<p>P.S. Any reasons you can think of that a single bat would screech and attack a person? Apparently this happened right outside of my house to my sister a few days ago. It rammed into her arm and then flew through her hair. Thankfully there were no bite or scratch marks visible.
