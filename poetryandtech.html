<div class="container"><h3>Poetry & Tech</h3><h5>05 Nov 2013 </h5><br>
<p>Recently I have been caught up in a flurry of a about a million things. Halloween ended and November came. Then my mother's birthday today (she's now 57). But somehow in between all of the craziness, I've found time to get some significant things accomplished. Recently I wrote to one of my most loved magazines, asking them if they would be interested in some of my poetry. To my astonishment, they said yes and are looking forward to a sample of my poetry for their magazine. I was shocked and exstatic, I only hope that my poetry will be accepted. If not not, I'm grateful for the opportunity.</p><p>
In other news, I've been attempting to learn DNSCrypt, SSH, and VPN's. I haven't gotten very far as I have been retrofitting this site. But hopefully I'll get to it soon. I've been working mainly with Git and Vim. Making sure I don't forget anything and putting it into muscle memory so to speak. I also found out that stores monitor when and how long you are in their store by pinging bluetooth and wifi in your phones and other tech. They are literally tracking your every move for their own purposes. Not cool.</p><p>
As far as reading goes, I haven't read anything substantial in a while (weeks?) Currently though I am reading a very lengthy article on the Vampire panic in New England in the 1800's. It's a good read if you like history, general mass panic, or a good dose of vampire lore. I also read a very convincing article about eliminating time zones which you may want to take a look at. <a href="http://feeds.apartmenttherapy.com/~r/apartmenttherapy/main/~3/X4TAqzXrNRM/would-two-time-zones-be-better-than-four-196826">ApartmentTherapy</a></p>
