Flux.</center></h3><center><p>They creep up, like a stalker hidden in the shadows of a dark alley way. Their name? "Generation Flux". Who are these people? Where do they come from? They shift and slip through the crowd, melting into invisibility. They bother the masses. Annoy them with ideas, panic and provoke with creativity, adaptation, and reflex. Instead of driving safe cars down the streets. They “free run”, “bike”, “motorcycle”, “velocity stilt”, and “zig zag” through the streets, before disappearing. ...</p><p>Instead of having job where they work a steady 12 hours a day. They travel, moving constantly to one destination or another. They group together and go their separate ways. They don't have jobs. They have "upstarts". They don't contribute to the economy, instead they use digital codes and paper, which they call "bitcoins" and "community currencies". When they do buy something, which is seldom, they keep it so long that it has needed repair dozens of times. Instead of tossing these disposable products into the nearest receptacle, they then learn how to repair these items themselves.</p><p>Instead of living in sturdy homes built in sprawling subdivisions. They live in apartments, yurts, other peoples homes, tipi's,tents, vans or “tiny homes”. Some of them even tout that the "commons" will save us. Well, how can that be? If we use our available commercial space for "gardens" and "community events" we would all starve.</p><p>These people have affected our way of life. They spread the falsifications that things such as our educational system should be free. That consumerism is wrong and that we should embrace "minimalism". That software should be "open-source" and freely given.These people are a danger to our society that has been built on the principles of consumerism, mass production, above all corporate loyalty. If we don't fund ouragricultural corporations, who will feed us? If the government doesn't spend millions offsetting our oil companies, how will we travel? If we don't work our allotted 12+ hours a day, our society would crumble and we would have nothing to do, but stare at our white walls all day.</p><p>This menace must be stopped. Anywhere you see a "Generation Flux" in action. Report them immediately. If you hear anyone spouting about the "commons", "green space","vegetarianism", "open-source", "free", "Bitcoins", "hacking", "bootstrapping","kickstarting", "upstarting","yoga", "green economy", "unlocked", "debt free", "couchsurfing", and above all "global warming" or "climate change". In addition but not limited to, speaking multiple foreign languages, slang, and all self sufficient activities.Please call your local Flux Detainment Facility.</p><p>This message is brought to you by your local subdivision mayor; Mayor Bill MeMore. In association with your local Flux Detainment Facility, a subgroup of the Bureau of Investigation and Detainment of Gen. Flux.</p><p>Thank you & Remember. Corporations serve the people.</p></center><br><br><hr>   <section id="content" class="content">  <div class="row">    <div class="span8">      <article id="page" class="page"><div class="ten columns"><h3>Notes </h3>      Everything on this site poofs into glittery fairy dust.
