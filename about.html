	<p><h4><strong><u>Bio</u></strong></h4></p>
	<hr>
    <p> A few years ago, I was like everyone else. I went to college, searched for a job, and went dizzy trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. Then, I ended up in debt up to my eyeballs and had to drop college because of some fancy new laws that were passed to keep out those who don't have a high school education. I went from a 4.0 GPA to sitting at home wondering what to do. After wrapping my mind around the subject and looking at every single angle, I decided to stop. Stop thinking about it, stop drowning in worry, just fix things and use that new found time for some self discovery. </p>
    <p>Fast forward to 2013, I'm a writer, I've done mixed media canvases for fund raising at Ranken Jordan (the hospital), and I've learned a lot about life and computers. I've found out that my main loves are writing, anthropology, and programming, something I never knew about myself. I'm working on becoming literate in web security, privacy, programming and working on the command line. </p>
    <p>If you come across me in real life (not likely), you'll see I don't like to talk. I'm a listener. If I'm in public, you might see me coding at the coffee shop, hagling fees with a librarian, walking my dog, or riding my beach cruiser. It's just as likely that I'll be reading a book or getting into an argument about strange topics. I can't carry on a light conversation, be warned, I love details.</p><hr>

<p><h4><strong><u>Where I'm Living</u></strong></h4></p>
<p>Right now, I'm in Missouri. I'm staying in a two bedroom house with my parents who had to move down here because my brother recently became paralyzed. I stay in the attic most of the time, with my border collie, typing on the keys and learning new things. Right now those things include PGP, JavaScript, and Vim.

<p><h4><strong><u>Top 10 Tools</u></strong></h4></p>
p>This is an ever changing list of my top ten tools of the moment.A list of challenges and things I'm working on.</p>
<p><ul>
<li>1. Vim | After reading Gwen's ten tools, I thought I was done for. A Gaman scale of 7/10 ! How would I defeat that? Well. The first week was tough, but it's been smooth sailing ever since. I learn about two new commands a day out of necessity and keep searchable notes but I barely use them. If I was to re-reate this on the Gaman scale I would say, the first week is a 7/10 after that 1/10 super simple my friend.</li>
<li>2. Command Line or Terminal | Since I'm on a mac, I've been learning Terminal. Honestly its just plain boring. Gwen has all the fun on her Arch box, Terminal is the living dead to say the least. On the Gaman scale? 5/10 for me.</li>
<li>3. Javascript | I don't have any books to learn this with and my wifi has been disconnected leaving me to give this very awesome lang with a Gaman of 8/10</li>
<li>4. PGP | Once you wrap your mind around it. It's awesome. Otherwise, it will warp your mind. Gaman scale: 8/10 first week. 1/10 second week. </li>
<li>5.CJDNS | </li>
<li>6. SSH |</li>
<li>7. Arch Linux |</li>
<li>8. Git |</li>
<li>9. Yoga |</li>
<li>10.VPS |</li>
</ul>

<p><h4><strong><u>My Current Challenges</u></strong></h4></p>
<p>French: In college I took three semesters of French and came out not being able to have a conversation in it. Although colleges seem to be great places to learn, they are not the best places to learn foreign languages. When I left college It was said I was high beginner / intermediate, it's been almost a year and I've lost most of it. I'm starting from square one and working my way to complete fluency. </p>

<p>Meditation: Another challenge for me is meditating. I'm planning on visiting a Zen Center in the near future and furthering my practice.</p>

<p>Kendo: (Samurai Sword Fighting) Next summer I hope to have moved to Washington state and plan on picking up this martial sport.</p>
