 <div class="container"><h3>Minimize the apps | Chindōgu</h3>

<p>If you are on a mac and learning the tech scene, there's something you need to know. All those apps out there to help you chat on IRC, or help you know Git? They're junk. Useless. </p>

<p>All they do is give you the illusion of being productive or of learning something. They don't do anything to help you learn. They hide it. The code, the knowledge, its locked up and swept under a rug. </p>

<p>Here's an example. IRC clients. I used to use them, they kept all the rooms open and ready for chat, remembered my user name etc. Everything was peachy. What happened? I realized that all the app was doing was locking away my IRC connection behind an interface that locked away certain interactions. It was almost like being <u>censored</u>. </p>

<p><blockquote>If you are using an app, instead of digging in the code and learning from the bones of it. Your interactions and what you get to know are all censored by the frilly app that promises its on your side and "helping" you. </blockquote></p>

<p>So, what do you do? Ditch'em. Drop the IRC client, leave the Git interface, throw away your frilly html text editors. Ya don't need 'em. They are just chains holding you back from actually learning something. </p>

<p>Wanna know what you do instead? <mark>Pull up that scary command line.</mark> Install Git, IRSSI, VIM, Mutt. Those are the tools. Learn them. If you want to learn how to use SSH or PGP / GPG, but only know how to use an interface. Download some tutorials and get to it on the command line. Your are not child, you don't need someone to hold your hand, bust out some tutorials and prove you are fully capable of being of badass tech wizard. Then, when you're done, go learn some programming.</p>
<p>This applies not only to apps. Everything can become Chindōgu or 'unuseless' in your life. If you have two hundred plus friends and you don't even know their names it's Chindōgu. If your inbox is filled with five hundred plus messages a day, it's Chindōgu. If you are multi-tasking and doing so many things you can't take a breath to meditate, it's Chindōgu. Cut the crap. Eliminate it. No matter how useful it seems, there's a point when something useful isn't anymore. Ditch it. Learn the bones. That's all there really is to it. ...</p>

<blockquote>Chindōgu is all about something new coming along and being seen as the hottest newest solution to a problem (iPhone?). Then, that wonderful new product becoming a social embarrassment and having no use whatsoever because it has become overcluttered, over designed, more things added, until this one useful thing has become unuseless.</blockquote>
