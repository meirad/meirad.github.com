I'll pursue solitary pathways Through the pale twilit meadows, With only this one dream: You come too.' ~ Rilke</h5></blockquote><br>    <p><a name="visit"></a></p>    <p><center><h4>Visit to the Hospital</h4></center></p><p>Something out of the blue happened to us (me and my family) yesterday. I wasn't there for all of it, so I'll tell you what they told me. My family (which includes my mother, father, little sister, and little brother) went shopping. Then they stopped off a Wendy's to grab a bite to eat. My brother started complaining that his legs were falling asleep and wobbled to the car. They then stopped off at Walgreens to pick up their medication. My brother started yelling to be brought home because he couldn't feel his legs, so they headed home without grabbing the medication. </p><p>Fast forward to home.  (This is where I come in)</p><p>Everyone was getting out of the car and rushing grocceries in. My dad got out of the car, turned around and saw my brother hanging out of the car and in the grass. He said he couldn't walk. My dad with his high blood pressure and heart problems lifted him off the ground and supported his entire weight to get him inside the house. He said his legs felt tingly. He couldn't stand and started moaning in frustration because he wanted to watch his new movie "Coraline". </p><p>We tried rubbing his legs, helping him into a chair etc. He slid out. He didn't have any control of his legs at all. Then his eye started getting red and drooping. He could and still only can open it halfway and it's still red. We called an ambulance, believing that it was that his legs were just asleep anymore. They had to carry him to the ambulance. We were at the hospital from 4-11 last night. </p><p>Over half that time the doctors believed him to be faking it and wanted to send him home unable to walk. Then they started doing tests, after my brother insisted he couldn't walk and tried to repetedly. By this time, he lost all functioning in his right arm. He actually punched himself in the face accidently. Then they finally got worried and decided to transfer him to a children's hospital. Where they drew the conclusion that since he isn't faking it, he must have been abused. Isn't it amazing how medical staff can draw the wrong conclusions because they are too lazy to look for the answer? </p><p>Now he cannot go to the bathroom and they still haven't found the problem. They are saying it's neurological. My brother has autism and a few other disorders that keep him from knowing how to tell the doctors what's wrong. What baffles me is how they think that this would result in him lying and I quote "translating kidney stone pain as weakness in the legs." I will probably always remember that strange doctors name.</p><p>Today, I'm sitting at home. Someone has to take Oreo outside every few hours. I packed my brother two stuffed animals, some movies, etc. I promised him I'd get him netflix. I have $5 out of the $8 I need. If anyone could be so kind as to help out with the $3 dollars I would be grateful. </p><p>I wish I was there today. I have no way to get updates on his condition and it is driving me up a wall. $40 bucks if anyone cares to donate for a month of cell service. I miss him. I miss his weird "flashlight eyes". He can't open wide anymore and give his spooky alert look. His eye won't open enough and he's on too much pain medication to be that alert. </p><p>I honestly would be grateful for any and all donations to help my brother. We are currently out of work and it's an hour drive to get to St.Louis one way. We can't afford the gas, and there's no way in hell we are going to leave him there alone. </p><p>So please donate, pray, etc. When he gets well (I'm not allowing any other option) I'll ask him to post a thank you video for all your support.</p>          <hr>        <br>          <p><a name="moretech"></a></p>          <center><h4>You Need More Than Web Skills</h4></center></p>                 <p> In order to evolve into a person that can adapt to "generation screwed" conditions, you need more than web programming skills. It's true that "program or be programmed" (~ev bogue) is more true than ever. But if you don't have hard skills, you aren't going to make it.  I challenge you now, to go and get those skills. </p>   <p>But what are these skills? How do we know what we need and where do we find them? Well, first of all they are anything and everything that will make you more self reliant. This is a big deal people. If you don't become self reliant, you will always have to rely on others. Those people, will be the first to fall.  </p>   <p>So, what can you do about it? I want you to think about everything you rely on in your daily lives. Make a list. Don't forget to add caffeine, we all know you are as addicted to it as everyone else.  I know a lady who lost her husband three years ago. She said that he did all of the cooking, and she didn't know how to make toast. Know what's happened to her three years later? She's awaiting heart surgery. These past three years, she's been slowly starving to death, and it damaged it heart, all because she never learned to cook. Do you want to be a statistic? Or do you want to be one of the few that adapt to the coming changes, no matter how dire?  </p><ul><li>Back to you list. Did you fill it out? Here's where we get down to business. Answer yes or no to the following.</li><li>Do you rely on a gym membership, martial art, yoga, or pilates class?</li><li>Do you rely on caffeine and sugar to wake up in the morning?</li><li>Do you eat?</li><li>Do you drive long distances? (10+ miles)</li><li>Do you throw stuff away or pay a repair man to fix things that are "broken"?</li></ul>   <p>This is a very simplistic list. I didn't want to go all out on a massive book sized list of things. But this should give you a good start. So, if you are like a lot of people and have a gym membership, drop it. Log on to Nerdfitness.com and get to studying how to get fit without a membership. If you cannot leave you wonderful Yoga or Pilates class. Leave it anyway and go through certification to teach it. It's the fastest way to learn as much as possible about something you love. Martial arts class? Just get your black belt. You'll be a badass in the end and won't have to sign up for another class. </p>   <p>Caffeine and sugar are another story. If you can cut caffeine out of your diet do it. If not, ditch the coffee. It's going extinct and it causes bad breath. Drink tea instead. For sugar, get something natural. Agave, honey, steavia. You can grow stevia and never have to pay for sugar again. </p>   <p>Yes. I know. Everyone eats. But what are you eating? Fast food? Lots of meat? Vegetables? Learn to cook and start a small garden. You won't be exclusively self reliant but you'll be getting there. Oh, and meat? Did you know that there will be 11 billion people on earth by 2100? I guarantee you there won't be that many cows around. There's been a lot of talk about bugs as a protein alternative. If you don't want to eat bugs before 2050, start looking at a vegetarian, if not vegan diet. </p>   <p>Driving. If it's less than 10 miles, bike it or walk it. Learn to repair bikes. You have to know how everything operates in order to fix it. Which brings us to the last item. No more consumerism, there won't be a planet left if 11 billion people want a new laptop every year, let alone wardrobes etc. Fix what you have, get under the hood. Learn. Know. Do. Teach it to others. </p>   <p>Now that we've broken down some of the basics, there's more. The U.S. government is now spending so much money on disaster relief that it is outpacing funding for schools etc. When New York got hit, their power was out for months. As someone who is self reliant, what are you going to do if something like that happens? I suggest you get some technical know how together. Otherwise you are your family will suffer during the time it takes for the government or other people to respond. </p>   <p> I would suggest if you are a woman, to go find someone who knows their tools. Learn about every one of them and how to use them. Then, learn to weld and / or solder. After than, learn some basic electrical skills. If you have a car, learn how to maintain it. There will be no more, "I'm a woman and cannot fathom this, where's IT when I need it? "You are IT. You are the automotive guru. The Yogini and the Black Belt. If you are guy and you don't have these skills? Get them. </p>     <p>You should be able to walk outside and at any point say, "I know how to do that."  Now get down to business and get your skills of self reliance.   </p>                <hr>        <br>     <p><a name="javascript"></a></p>     <center><h4>   JavaScript: Up Your Tech Skills</h4></center></p><p>I've been working my butt off on Javascript. I'm in a book called, "JavaScript & jQuery: the missing manual". It's been a killer of a ride the past week upping my tech skills. So, far I've ended up getting an injury in my left arm from coding so much. I'm now on chapter 6 or page 185 so far. Surprisingly jQuery is kicking my butt while JavaScript is making a lot of sense. I still have a few typo's here  and there but it's a good book. </p><p>Since I've hit the halfway point in this ebook, I've been thinking a lot on the next JavaScript book I'm going to hit. Here's a list of just a few of the JavaScript books I've been blessed with acquiring and how I'm going to bust them out.</p><p><ul><li>JavaScript & jQuery: the missing manual</li><li>Learning JavaScript</li><li>Elegant JavaScript</li><li>JavaScript the Definitive Guide</li><li>JavaScript Enlightenment</li></ul></p><p>If you are like me and hoping to up your tech skills, I have five pieces of advice. </p><p><ul><li>1. Learn HTML5 & CSS3</li><li>2. Email me for links to tech ebooks to up your skills and practice programming</li><li>3. Subscribe to Gwen Bell's newsletter on tech skills. </li><li>4.

Suddenly, you don't know who you are, you are split into several alternate fragments of the same being. All while having to write research papers and study for exams. So, what do you do? Do allow yourself to be reformed, transformed, shaped, and pushed along with the flow of the river of knowledge and students? Or do you forge your own river?</p> <p>For me, I'm forced to sit in a room and listen to people give half answers or say things such as, "Thoreau is soo boring, I had to like stop after two sentences..." Is this really how we want to portray ourselves to others? What happened to academic achievement? Of philosophical thought and long discussions?</p> <p>Today in class my instructor asked the students, if someone was injured, hurt or being hurt, is it your moral responsibility to help them? The students unanimously agreed that it was not their moral responsibility to help anyone, unless it was convienent for them or they wanted to do so. They also agreed that people should pay for their healthcare, and if they are too poor to support themselves or afford it, so be it. They shouldn't be allowed care, as long as it didn't cost them anything or effect them personally, it was alright by them.</p> <p>It was one of several disappointments I've felt lately in the classroom and on campus in general. What happened to morality? Reason? Logic? Were they pilfered and scattered on the winds? And did anyone tell these people that Social Darwinism was an awful blot in our history? Why then are these people still stuck in such a web of lies? </p><hr><br> <p><a name="ebook"></a></p> <center><h4>June 14  | Ebook</h4></center></p> <p>As you know, I've been writing an ebook recently. There are little hints on the front page of this website. Psst. look in the sidebar for the "coming soon". Anyway, I bet a lot of you are wondering what it's about. Well, it's about superheroes, more specifically, "<strong>Your Inner Superhero</strong>".  </p><p>I don't want to give a lot of info away yet, I'm just now pounding on the keys to finish chapter two. But if you are one of those people who love movies, specifically the heroes and the villians. This just might be a book you want to read.</p> <hr><h4>P.S.</h4> <div class="mark"> <p>  If you are looking for a past letter. Look on Github and find the file "archive".
