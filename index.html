    <span class="c3">gz</span>% ** <span class="c4">Thur  Jan </span>02 <span class="c3">4:22 PM </span><span class="c4">CST</span> 2013 **</div><p>It's a new  year and time for change. Time for keeping true to those new years resolutions too. I bet you are wondering what mine are. ... Well, for one I didn't want it to be one of those years where I never stick to the resolutions. So I'm determined to finish this year. My resolutions are to be more self sufficient, work on my programming skills, and get my Etsy shop up and running. I have other promises to myself as well, such as getting my GED. But Self Sufficiency is a whole other animal. This year I'm taking up Archery. I bought a beautiful hand made wood recurve from Etsy and I hope to eventually learn how to fletch my own arrows. I'm dragging the whole family into the self sufficiency thing too. My sister is going to learn archery and my dad is going to start hand making knives. I'm still working on idea's for my mom and brother, but I'll figure it out. I'm also going to attempt to learn crochet this year and crochet an entire blanket. I got the tools, now I need the knowledge. A group project me and my sister will be working on is making a radio antenna and seeing if it picks anything up. We have lots to do and only a year to work on it. But who knows, it just might be something we work on every year from now on. Self Sufficiency is a very important skill. ... </p> <p>P.S. Here's a sample of what I'm working on for my Etsy shop.<center> <img src= "mockup.jpg" height="200" width="300" alt="image description" /></a></center> </p>

I hope you all had a wonderful holiday. Lately I've been so busy I haven't had the time to tend to this site. It's beginning to feel like an unruly vining plant instead of what it truely is. ... A place to express ideas, sentiments, and well wishes. Perhaps it's just the feeling of New Year's being around the corner. I don't know. But my hopes are nearly boundless for the coming year. I plan on writing more, not just a status message. A status message is an ungly word this year. I hope to send real messages that allow the reader and the author / writer to become better people. Isn't that what writing is about? It's about sharing, not generic lists of what you did, but the true heart of a matter, idea, etc. So, for those of you still up and maybe a little tired from this past 25th. Get some rest. Relax. The new year isn't here yet. And if you are like me and wondering what you should do as far as resolutions. The answer is simple. Don't bog yourself down. Treasure every day. And instead of simply scraping by day to day in an effort to exist. Live. ... </p>
