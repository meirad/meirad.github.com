Most of the time i'm left feeling drained and tired after a conversation. Not for lack of trying to communicate. But for a lack of dialogue between me and the person I am talking to. It seems the art of conversation has died. </p>      <p>I read an interesting quote today that said, </p><p><strong>"Conversation is the laboratory and workshop of the student."</strong> by<cite> Ralph Waldo Emerson</cite>. </p>      <p>Without dialog, without conversation, we aren't truely sharing and learning with other people. We are monologing. ... Stifling innovation and creativity. Creating "mindsmog". It's beyond time that we take back the art of conversing with one another...</p>      <br><br>        </div></div></div>   <section id="content" class="content">  <div class="row">    <div class="span8">      <article id="page" class="page"><div class="ten columns"><h3>Notes </h3>      Everything on this site poofs into glittery fairy dust.

Before I got rid of G**gle I heard that there was a Bitcoin debit card. I thought. That's cool, where can I get them? Turns out, they aren't for sale anymore. So, I sat down yesterday with Lightroom, Artboard, and some css tinkering and made my own; complete with fake magnetic strip.</p>     <p>These cards actually work for sending and receiving, when linked to a Bitcoin address. If anyone has Artboard installed on their computer and would like a copy of this template for their own use. Just shoot me an <a href= "mailto:"meira.datiya@gmail.com">e-mail</a>. The template costs the small amount of 0.01 Bitcoins. Which you can send through a small donation on this web site. For 0.2 Bitcoins I'll custom make the cards for you and email you the finished images. Just make sure to send me your QR code, and send and receive numbers. </p>    <p>  Here's a preivew:</p>      <br>      <img src= "preview.jpg"  alt="beta version of Minimal Write" /></a>      </div></div></div>  <br><br><br>      </article>       <div class="five columns offset-by-one sidebar"><img src="Index/Oreo.jpg" style="border: 1px solid;  #ccc; padding: 4px; margin-bottom: 1em;" width="100%" >         <h2>Hi, I'm Meira.</h2>  <p> Learning the Dark Arts of <a href="http://www.github.com/meirad">Web Developement</a>, in a small town where wifi is a rare link to the outside world. </p> <p>Interesting Reading: <a href="http://www.gwenbell.com">Gwen Bell</a> ,<a href="http://www.zenhabits.net">ZenHabits</a> , <a href="http://www.mnmlist.com">Mnmlist</a> </p></p>       <center>{ <a href="about.html">About</a> } </center>       <center>{ <a href="https://tinyletter.com/meirad">Letter</a> } </center>        <script>var CoinWidget_Config = {	address : '11oWesLztFeHsfzLc9oodpMv8W3LC92uc'};</script><script src="http://c.coinwidget.com/widget.js"></script><br><br>      </div>    </div>         </div>  </div></div></section>    </div>    <script type="text/javascript" src="/Index/prettify.js"></script>    <script type="text/javascript" src="/Index/jquery.js"></script>    <script type="text/javascript" src="/Index/bootstrap.js"></script>    <script type="text/javascript" src="/Index/script.js"></script>        </script><iframe src="index/widget.html" id="coinbase_modal_iframe_e284433f66f1c5204bb0642cb11a555a" name="coinbase_modal_iframe_e284433f66f1c5204bb0642cb11a555a" style="background-color: transparent; border: 0px none transparent; overflow: hidden; display: none; position: fixed; visibility: visible; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; left: 0px; top: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; z-index: 9999;" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></body></html>
