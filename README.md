This is my personal website.

Domain name is forward masked instead of using CNAME attributes with GoDaddy.

"The Life Stream has gotten a major overhaul if you haven't noticed. From now on and into eternity, it will only show posts for a little while. Then *poof!* they dissapear into a pile of glittery fairy dust."

The only part of this website that's copyrighted is the Skeleton.css etc. Currently looking for a replacement to make this website completly uncopyrighted.

This website is based on Bitters by Gwen Bell, but is not an instance of Bitters. It's a cross between Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, & jQuery.

This website blank slates, all letters can be found in the Archive.  The life stream isn't backed up (100% blank slate).

Once complete, there will a link to a true resume and the Un-Resume will be edited & simplified.
