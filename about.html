Vim |</strong> After reading Gwen's ten tools, I thought I was done for. A Gaman scale of 7/10 ! How would I defeat that? Well. The first week was tough, but it's been smooth sailing ever since. I learn about two new commands a day out of necessity and keep searchable notes but I barely use them. If I was to re-reate this on the Gaman scale I would say, the first week is a 7/10 after that 1/10 super simple my friend.<p><center>Progress: <progress id="progressbar" max="100.00" value="75.00">75%</progress></center></p></li>	<li><strong>2. Command Line or Terminal |</strong> Since I'm on a mac, I've been learning Terminal. Honestly its just plain boring. Gwen has all the fun on her Arch box, Terminal is the living dead to say the least. On the Gaman scale? 5/10 for me.<p><center>Progress: <progress id="progressbar" max="100.00" value="50.00">50%</progress></center></p></li>	<li><strong>3. Javascript |</strong> I don't have any books to learn this with and my wifi has been disconnected leaving me to give this very awesome lang with a Gaman of 8/10</p><p><center>Progress: <progress id="progressbar" max="100.00" value="10.00">10%</progress></center></p></li>	<li><strong>4. PGP |</strong> Once you wrap your mind around it. It's awesome. Otherwise, it will warp your mind. Gaman scale: 8/10 first week. 1/10 second week. <br><br>		<strong>Note:</strong> Recently I have learned that PGP/GPG has some amazing capabilities. Not only is it used to encrypt your email, but it can be used to encrypt tag's in Git, instant messaging conversations and more. I thought I had learned it all. But it seems my learning has just begun on this front. I'm now delving into the advanced levels of PGP. <p><center>Progress: <progress id="progressbar" max="100.00" value="89.00">89%</progress></center></p></li>	<li><strong>5.CJDNS |</strong> </li>	<li><strong>6. SSH |</strong> SSH Tunneling etc. seems easy enough. I hope to set up SSH to my email soon. Gaman: 3/10<p><center>Progress:     <progress id="progressbar" max="100.00" value="45.00">45%</progress></center></p></li>	<li><strong>7. Arch Linux |</strong>So, far I have read a book by Ev Bogue on installing the system on a computer. I hope to set up a Raspberry Pi with it as soon and start delving into it.</p><p><center>Progress: <progress id="progressbar" max="100.00" value="15.00">15%</progress></center></li>	<li><strong>8. Git |</strong> Version control is nice. I love Git. So far I'm into the meat of it. I can run it from the command line, add files, remove, push, pull, commit etc.  Gaman: 8/10</p><p> <center>Progress: <progress id="progressbar" max="100.00" value="70.00">70%</progress></center></p> </li>	<li><strong>9. Python |</strong> I've just started learning Python, so it's sort of confusing. I'd say it's kind of like learning HTML all over again. Gaman of 7/10. </p><p><center>Progress: <progress id="progressbar" max="100.00" value="10.00">10%</progress></center></p></li>	<li><strong>10.VPN |</strong> Right now, I'm looking in to rolling my own VPN, possibly with a Rasberry Pi. Reading up on it now. Gaman: 8/10<p><center>Progress:	<progress id="progressbar" max="100.00" value="05.00">5%</progress></center></p></li></ul></p><hr><p><a name="Challenges"></a></p><p><h4><strong><u>My Current Challenges</u></strong></h4></p><p>French: In college I took three semesters of French and came out not being able to have a conversation in it. Although colleges seem to be great places to learn, they are not the best places to learn foreign languages. When I left college It was said I was high beginner / intermediate, it's been almost a year and I've lost most of it. I'm starting from square one and working my way to complete fluency. </p><p>Meditation: Another challenge for me is meditating. I'm planning on visiting a Zen Center in the near future and furthering my practice.</p><p>Kendo: (Samurai Sword Fighting) Next summer I hope to have moved to Washington state and plan on picking up this martial sport.</p></li> <hr>                <center><h5>&#39;'Everything is blooming most recklessly; if it were voices instead of colors, there would be an unbelievable shrieking into the heart of the night.' &#39;<br></h5></center>                <div class="c2">                    <h5>~ Rilke</h5>                </div>         </div>  </body></html>
