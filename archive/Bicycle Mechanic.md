<p>As you know, I've been working on becoming more self reliant this year. Unfortunately, I have had absolutely no idea what that entails. So, I've decided to do it by blending past and present together to create a set of missions or goals to hit. The first of these goals, inspired by <a href="https://www.diy.org">DIY.org</a> is <strong>Bicycle Mechanic</strong>. </p>
<p>The coming weeks will be dedicated to tool aquisition and the building of a tool kit. According to DIY's website a small list of materials should include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adjustable Wrench</li>
<li>Cone Wrench</li>
<li>Philips Screwdriver</li>
<li>Cable Cutters</li>
<li>Crank Puller</li>
<li>Repair Stand</li>
<li>Chain Tool</li>
<li>Metrix Hex Keys</li>
<li>Spoke Wrench</li>
<li>Chain Whip</li>
<li>Patch Kit</li>
<li>Tire Levers</li>
</ul>
<p>It's a good starting list, that's for sure. But if you're like me and bought an awesome bicycle that's been stripped down past the necessities. There's some things you gotta add to this list. </p>
<ul>
<li> oil</li>
<li>Steel Scrubber</li>
<li>WD-40</li>
<li>Bell</li>
<li>Tire Inner Tubes</li>
<li>Lights</li>
<li>Glue</li>
<li>Basket or paniers</li>
<li>Caps for tires</li>
<li>Water bottle holder & Steel Water bottle</li>
<li>Bike fenders</li>
</ul>
<p> The oil and steel scrubber are excellent for getting rid of any and all rust on your bicycle in just moments. WD-40 is kind of self explanatory. The inner tubes? Well, you cannot have enough of them if you live in a rural area where it can take 40+ minutes to find a shop that may or may not sell extra's. Caps tend to disappear when needed most and your handle bars are sure to fall off, or if made of rubber rot in hot temperatures. The rest is just convience and safety options that should have come with your bicycle. If they didn't, then you better get'em.</p>

<p>I think when these two lists are combined, you've got pretty much everything covered except a bike seat, brakes and a backup chain, to rebuild your entire bike and possibly trick it out a little. I would also suggest a tape measure, for seeing what size tires are required for your bike as well.</p>

<p> Now that I've covered all of that, you might think I'm already a bicycle mechanic. Well, I'm not. I don't know any of the tools of the trade and although somewhat technically inclined, it's going to be an interesting mission that's for sure. So, I'll leave this letter at that. It's time to go dig up some tools. ...</p>
