Where's the love?

The other day for me was probably one of the most trying days I've had in a long time. Stoicism? NVC? Meditation? It was tossed out the window. I feel bad for that. But here's what happened. I probably should have handled it differently, but I don't know. ...

Tuesday afternoon I logged on to my email and opened two messages from my online Anthropolgy teacher. She slammed me. "This is unfortunate. ... I'll have to pass this on to the College. ... I want an explanation - or I'm going to drop both exam grades." She also mentioned Academic Dishonesty and a bunch of other heavy hitting words. 

Know what happened? I took a final. Then, my sister took her final. We shared a computer; nothing else. She claims we did it on purpose and that we both cheated. She also claimed that we took the exam way too fast for the grades we got, that was her reasoning for failing us.

She offered us to prove that we didn't cheat by re-taking the exam; proctered. We showed up, no exam available. We called, she talked down to us both individually on the phone. Eventually after walking around campus for four hours with pneumonia, she allowed us to retake the exam proctered. 

I finished the exam with a 94% in less that fifteen minutes for a 50 minute exam. She finally believed us and allowed us to keep an averaged grade. My sister flunked it. She had an anxiety attack from all the pressure. 

After this, I had to go to work, where I got sick from heat exhaustion and no water. 

On my way home to pick up boxes for moving, we found out that our reserved boxes were taken. Walking out of the store empty handed, I found my mom screaming at the top of her lungs at someone I didn't even know. 

Apparently, while we were in the store. Some guy was screaming at the kids in the car next to us. Roaring down verbal assaults and beating the car seats. After my mom threatened to report him. He attempted to run her over, but thought better of it. 

Then, another family started screaming at their kid while I was there. They yelled at him to buckle his seat belt and scoot over. I heard the smack. The screaming cries for his mom. The "You shut up boy!" and the mocking whines of the mother to her son.

What ever happened to the love? 

Have we become so enclosed within ourselves that we can't see each other anymore? It's time to shut off the phones. Turn off the televisions. And take back our lives. ...
