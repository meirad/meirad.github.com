To the point of knowing what every single past article has said. I've read their entire archive. I tend to do strange things like that when I relate to something ( it almost never happens). But why am I telling you this? Well, I'm pretty sure I'm on the edge, of not just a lifestyle change, but a change also in my point of view. It's strange and a little scary. ... But for every article I've been reading and for every old book I've been attempting to find a read, there's been a shift in my reality. </p><p>I think there's a little bit of fear involved every time we experience one of those shifts. It's almost like feeling the floor falling out beneath you, but knowing you are going to bounce back up. Instead of being terrified you know it is there, but you also still have the feeling of falling that scares you half to death.</p><p>So, here's where I am today. I'm ok without the internet. I log on, check my messages, download articles to read, upload my web posts and that's it. Sometimes I'll search for a book or something for my e-reader but only if I know what I'm looking for. I've cut down my time to about 15 minues every other day. Except on days where I'm looking for a certain book. </p><p>I have an addiction forming for strange normally unused archaic words and letter writing. My poetry is improving. I've started collecting inspirational unheard of quotes. I'm reading older and longer books ( there are things longer than Harry Potter out there that are not legalese). Everything from Rilke to Thoreau's 2 million + words journal. I'm starting to hate soda and only drink it when I don't have another choice. I love mixing fruit juices with Perrier or having hot tea with cream. I have a growing addiction to drawing with oil pastels ( not sure how that happened ). </p><p>I'm addicted to Picadilly notebooks ( the extremely cheap cousin of moleskins ). I want to deck out my cruiser bicycle and use it for my main form of transport for short distances. I have no urge to purchase a car. The thought that there isn't a bakery nearby has compelled me to learn how to make english muffins, biscuits, focaccia, and ciabatta from scratch. The lack of desserts that weren't in a box has caused me to learn how to make pies, Cranberry Apple Tort, Icelandic Christmas Cake, and numerous types of cookies.</p><p> I don't like to shop new if I can help it. I've bought Itallian silver goblets, a marble cutting board, ceramic Chinese bowls, a Japanese jewelry box, and a handmade bird cage; all second hand. I look for books that are out of print. I became a poetry snob. I write all of the time. These are just a few of the changes I've noticed.</p>  <p> I think I've started to also invest in small experiences without knowing to. Such as, sitting at the Irish Coffee Shop for hours on end listening to the Irish reels and songs. As well as, getting a beautiful French easel, which I cannot wait to use for hours on end. These things once they start seem to keep bouncing off each other and creating more and new changes in my life. It's like I flipped the first domino and the chain of living a real life started hitting me in stages. And honestly, I'm curious about what's next in line. ...</p> <p> P.S. If you have any old copies of Darling Magazine I would love to have them. I cannot afford shipping. But if you would send like to send me your old copy. I'll write you a beautiful handwritten thank you in return. You can send your copy to P.O. Box 221 Winfield, MO 63389</p><br><hr><p><a name="rightnow"></a></p>    <p><center><h4>Right Now</h4></center></p><p>Right now I'm crashed out my parents couch with a headache. I think I got too dehydrated and hot today from being caught in traffic on the highway. Anyway, I just wanted to take this small moment in my agony to tell you about what's been happening. </p><p>I've changed a lot in past two weeks. My entire perspective on life and how we are supposed to live is being rewritten every day. </p><p>I've been searching forever for how to live what I believe in, to be inline with those values, that are so intrisically apart of who I am. I think I found it. After reading the "Dial Letters" by Emerson and Thoreau, as well as working through the second half of "Walden, " I realized that we live on the web way too much. </p><p>We use apps that are actually useless in the long run because they are designed for non-stop connectivity to the computer. Since my brain and probably yours too, isn't connected to the computer via wireless connection at all times. What's the point? There isn't a need to be online all the time to have a budget, or to log on to get your task list for the day, or even to check your calendar. So why do we? Why do we constantly log on? Constantly edit that list because it isn't analog or keep logging on to check our messages? I think it's because, we forgot there was a better way. ...</p><p>So, my plan is to get a few beautiful moleskins and some stationary. I plan to write my task list by hand, following the ZTD method by Leo Babauta. My schedule will be in the style of Benjamin Franklin. My budget will be vaules based. But what does this mean?</p><p>Value based budgeting is a beautiful mixture of minimalism, Benjamin Franklin's vaule chart, an idea hot bed, budget, and project list. Basically, you start out with a normal budget, income, fixed, discretionary. Then, you get another page and write out three vaules that resound with you financially. Then, you brainstorm. </p><p>Think of all the ways that you can live these pricipals. If you chose something like Health or Happiness as a value. You can make your own lunch sack or buy only from the farmers market. If you chose something like Independence, go debt free. Start writing letters snail mail style, save for your dream vacation etc. They are your's for the taking and living. That's what it's all about anyway; getting away from that screen your eyes are glued to and living.</p><p>If you do this, you have time for so much more in your life. Here's an example. I never get up at 6:40 am I'm a 10:00 am person. But today at HavenHouse I woke at 6:40 am. Here's what I got done before 10:00 am:</p><ul><li>Breakfast</li><li>Brush Teeth</li><li>Shower</li><li>Pack for leaving</li><li>Charge Ipad</li><li>Cook</li><li>Pack lunch</li><li>Take a nap</li><li>Read some articles</li></ul><p>That's a lot of stuff, I normally would have slept through. I failed to mention that I stared for about ten minutes watching a strange squirrel roll in the grass and watched the fog roll in. All things I would have hated to miss. </p><br><hr><p><a name="poetry"></a></p>    <p><center><h4>Poetry Submital & Haven House</h4></center></p><p>It's my second day here at HavenHouse. A non-profit which acts a lot like a hotel. It's almost like living in a boarding house. Every day you wake up and walk out of your hotel-esque room to a dining hall, where food is served for free to the residents. All of which, are families with someone who is at one of the local hospitals. It's interesting. We operate like a small community. There are rooms for watching tv, small kitchens, and laundry rooms, which everyone rushes to get to before they are full. There is even free shuttle service to the local hospitals. So, far we have met people that live but three miles from where we do, all the way to Texas. It's all been very interesting.</p><p>Also, I submitted my first poem to a magazine. I'm hoping for good news, but you never know. If they send me a mass generic rejection letter, no hard feelings, I need the constructive critisism to further my craft. There are few different literary magazines out there I hope to publish to in the future.</p> <p>But for those who think you might make a lot of money doing it; you don't. If you are among the top 1% you may make $10 dollars a line. You don't become a poet or a writer for the money. You become a poet and a writer because you couldn't think of being anything else. So, that's pretty much all of an update I can give right now. In the next 6-8 weeks while I'm waiting on word for my first poem, I'm going to be writing a few more. They may be good, they may be crap. But the important thing is to keep writing. </p><hr>   <p><a name="detox"></a></p>    <p><center><h4>Life Detox</h4></center></p><p>I'm detoxing my life. It's been a long process of figuring out what needs to be gotten rid of and how to change my life for the better. But I think I finally have an idea about how to do it. Most of what I write for you to read online isn't anything like how I write for myself in my journal. Usually I'm writing about tech, security, or some other very light topic. My reality is a lot different. </p><p>Usually, I sit and think for a lot of the day. I contemplate. This past week it's been on wisdom, the environment, why we only skitter across the top of an idea but never really work it into thought, blank slating, detoxing, what really matters in our short lives and how to be truely present in that time frame. It's a lot to think about. But I have hours sitting in a hospital bedside, by my brother, to contemplate them. </p><p>Here's some things that aren't important to me anymore:</p><ul><li>+ <strong>A job</strong> ( meaningless, soul sucking, corporation, or mindless inducing.)</li><li>+ <strong>Worry</strong> ( it takes away from what's happening in that moment, so you are not their for yourself or others.)</li><li>+ <strong>Lots of stuff</strong> ( Although I won't be ready for the 100 things challenge, I definitely don't see a reason to continue being a constant consumer and will be shearing a lot of my crap.)</li><li>+ <strong>Fear</strong> (You can be afraid and worry to your hearts content. But it is only a block to keep you from doing what you need to be doing.)</li><li>+ <strong>How other people think I should be.</strong> ( Don't let other people form your opinion of yourself, and don't let them mold you into one of the masses, you are a unique person, stay that way.)</li><li>+ <strong>Reading abridged books</strong> which were supposedly only for children, but have sneaked into adult reading. That's right, we all read on a highschool level, that is unless you started reading unabridged classics (Good luck finding them). </li></strong></ul><p>So, I'm detoxing. Detoxing away from the crap that fills our lives to the brim. Detoxing from worry and fear. I've cut down my time on the web. I've cut down my time on the computer. They both take away from who we are in a way.</p><p>I've started experimenting with living a deeper life. Part of this has resulted in a planning stage. I'm currently taking apart Benjamin Franklins old DIY GTD system and converting it into a modern equivalent. I'm reading Thoreau, not just Walden, but his letters and journals. Thoreau thought deep thoughts, he absorbed what was around him and was mindful about everything. He was a great intellectual. So, that's where I'm starting. Then, I will read other people's works. </p><p>I've also started writing again. Really writing. Not that light stuff that skims the surface of our thought processes but the deep stuff. It's a lot harder to do, but the payoff is immense. I'm not sure how far I'm going to go with this experiment in deeper living, It won't be to the point of a shack in the woods, I'm too terrified of the mountain lions for that. But it will be an experiment with a lot of steps and challenges. It will involve getting rid of things, acquiring a few things, simplifying, and a lot of experimentation. So, as I begin my journey, I would like to pose a question. Would you take the challenge?</p></h5></blockquote><hr>   <p><a name="reading"></a></p>    <p><center><h4>Reading Now</h4></center></p><p>I've been reading a ton lately, while busy shuttling back and forth to the hospital to visit my brother. So, I thought I would include a small running list here. Just until my brother recovers. It's been a really rough time and I don't feel like I should talk about it just yet, so in the meantime, there is the list.</p><ul><li> Poems by Robert Frost</li><li>Rilke's Letter's to a Young Poet</li><li>August Rodin by Rilke</li><li>Thoreau's letters to Emerson</li></ul><p>P.S. Lately me any my sister have been extremely bored on the 55+ mile drive one way to the hospital, so we've been working on numerous lists. One of them being the best multi-inventors, another for great muscians etc. When we are finished, I'll post them. *Hint: Tesla made the list.</p><hr>    <p><a name="visit"></a></p>    <p><center><h4>Visit to the Hospital</h4></center></p><p>Something out of the blue happened to us (me and my family) yesterday. I wasn't there for all of it, so I'll tell you what they told me. My family (which includes my mother, father, little sister, and little brother) went shopping. Then they stopped off a Wendy's to grab a bite to eat. My brother started complaining that his legs were falling asleep and wobbled to the car. They then stopped off at Walgreens to pick up their medication. My brother started yelling to be brought home because he couldn't feel his legs, so they headed home without grabbing the medication. </p><p>Fast forward to home.  (This is where I come in)</p><p>Everyone was getting out of the car and rushing grocceries in. My dad got out of the car, turned around and saw my brother hanging out of the car and in the grass. He said he couldn't walk. My dad with his high blood pressure and heart problems lifted him off the ground and supported his entire weight to get him inside the house. He said his legs felt tingly. He couldn't stand and started moaning in frustration because he wanted to watch his new movie "Coraline". </p><p>We tried rubbing his legs, helping him into a chair etc. He slid out. He didn't have any control of his legs at all. Then his eye started getting red and drooping. He could and still only can open it halfway and it's still red. We called an ambulance, believing that it was that his legs were just asleep anymore. They had to carry him to the ambulance. We were at the hospital from 4-11 last night. </p><p>Over half that time the doctors believed him to be faking it and wanted to send him home unable to walk. Then they started doing tests, after my brother insisted he couldn't walk and tried to repetedly. By this time, he lost all functioning in his right arm. He actually punched himself in the face accidently. Then they finally got worried and decided to transfer him to a children's hospital. Where they drew the conclusion that since he isn't faking it, he must have been abused. Isn't it amazing how medical staff can draw the wrong conclusions because they are too lazy to look for the answer? </p><p>Now he cannot go to the bathroom and they still haven't found the problem. They are saying it's neurological. My brother has autism and a few other disorders that keep him from knowing how to tell the doctors what's wrong. What baffles me is how they think that this would result in him lying and I quote "translating kidney stone pain as weakness in the legs." I will probably always remember that strange doctors name.</p><p>Today, I'm sitting at home. Someone has to take Oreo outside every few hours. I packed my brother two stuffed animals, some movies, etc. I promised him I'd get him netflix. I have $5 out of the $8 I need. If anyone could be so kind as to help out with the $3 dollars I would be grateful. </p><p>I wish I was there today. I have no way to get updates on his condition and it is driving me up a wall. $40 bucks if anyone cares to donate for a month of cell service. I miss him. I miss his weird "flashlight eyes". He can't open wide anymore and give his spooky alert look. His eye won't open enough and he's on too much pain medication to be that alert. </p><p>I honestly would be grateful for any and all donations to help my brother. We are currently out of work and it's an hour drive to get to St.Louis one way. We can't afford the gas, and there's no way in hell we are going to leave him there alone. </p><p>So please donate, pray, etc. When he gets well (I'm not allowing any other option) I'll ask him to post a thank you video for all your support.</p>          <hr><br><hr><h4>P.S.</h4> <div class="mark"> <p>  If you are looking for a past letter.
