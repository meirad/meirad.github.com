This is my personal website, created with Bitters & my own customizations. 

Domain name is forward masked instead of using CNAME attributes with GoDaddy.

"The Life Stream has gotten a major overhaul if you haven't noticed. From now on and into eternity, it will only show posts for the past week. Then *poof!* they dissapear into a pile of glittery fairy dust."

Index.html is the main page that uses a daily "stream" that is deleted by hand every 7 days. 

Will overhaul in the future to include Bitters and export this code into a new repo.
