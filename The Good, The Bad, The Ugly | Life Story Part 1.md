"Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself" ~ Rumi
			
For a lot of my life, I've been angry. Angry at the world, angry at people, and angry at myself. Most noteably for how we treat the environment that we live in and for how we treat other beings caught up in living, like we are, whether they be human or animal. For me, nature was everything, I grew up having asthma in the city, and nature was where I made my escape. I would sit in the forest, under a tall oak my a creek and let the sun shine down, while I took large gulps of fresh air and wrote. It was truely a place of peace for me. 

So when I was older and I began to hear about the horrible things we all do to this beautiful place we are supposed to call home, it cut deep. I started to become angry at everyone, because for me, the forest wasn't just trees, it held special meaning for me. I was the one place where everything seemed right, and I suppose it seemed magical to me. It still does. I guess I sort of feel about the forests and animals the way the Na'Vi felt about it on Avatar. It felt alive to me, and I was connected with it. The thought of cutting it down for houses was a threat to my very life. 

Fast forward to 2010, I'm 21. Angry. Living in a small town where I seem to fixate on counting the trees. I feel bad when the large golden maple begins to die in our backyard. It's one less tree, not just for me, but for the beautiful mourning doves that have come to populate our town. 

I log onto the internet and find Urgent Evoke, a game of social innovation to teach people how to adapt in the wake of global warming and massive amounts of pollution. I thought. Maybe we can change people. Maybe, we can make a difference this way. And it did to some extent. Some people went on to establish many new community endeavors. But none of them were environmental. 

So, I decided to plant some beautiful loblolly trees. One a summer day, I dug. dug. and dug some more. They were finally planted. A neighbor came over and offered some mulch   for them. I thought, I'm making a difference, even if it's small. I walked down to the plot of land all summer to check on my trees. After a while, I noticed something. They were disappearing. I got angry and asked my grandpa who lived next door to the plot what was going on. It turned out, the person who had leant me the mulch, was cutting them down. 

I became depressed. Someone burned an apple tree down. Another person was burning leaves, an yet another decided to burn a house. All of this black smoke swiriling through the air I had to attempt to inhale. I stayed at home more. Stopped counting the trees. Listened to all the horrible eco news I could get my hands on and sat around being disgusted at the world, the small town I lived in, and at myself for being too sick, angry, and depressed to do anything about it. 

That ugly spell lasted for a long time. I still feel horrible when I see tree's destroyed. It hurts. But since all of those years ago. I began to realize something. I wanted to change the world. But I never changed myself first. Sure, I recycle, I ride a bike when the air is semi-breathable, and I don't drive. It wasn't my actions that were the problem. It was what I was feeling. 

Between 2010 and 2013 things have been a lot different. I stumbled across some amazing people on the internet. Leo, Ev, and Gwen. They taught me more that they will probably ever know, about how to find peace, live a fulfilling life, not to take anything for granted, to not settle for being average but to head for the edge, and to see that people are just people. 

I discovered minimalism, writing, photography, meditation, web development, yoga, simplicity, peace of mind, tranquility, and stoicism. I even learned to get exercise and be a nerd at the same time from Steve. They broke the cycle of anger and disgust for me. By proving that you can change the world. By changing yourself first. 

So, what are my plans now? Writing and lots of it, along with a steep amount of what i'm going to call 'mindfulness rehab'. I'm moving away from this small town that loves to burn things and i'm going to live among the pines in Washington. I've also begun to meditate daily, and practice Stoicism and minimalism as if my life depended on it. Coding bootcamp in Seattle. Running. Lot's of Yoga. 

For a long time it seems, my happiness has depended on what others do. Whether they did what I considered was right or not. But that's not how the world works. Happiness depends only on yourself and what you do for others. 

I will offering letters and a lot of them in the future as I finally grab my mat and head down my first journey dedicated soley to living and living well. There are also some ebooks in the works. And I hope, at least someone out there, will join me in the challenge of letting go and living well. 

As for that magically forest I was talking about in the begining? It's in Arizona, there are Grizzly bears there, I once was chased out of the forest by one. I don't know if the forest still survives, if not it's a tragedy. But if it is still there, I challenge you to visit, hit the small towns, throw snowballs in the middle of summer in Flagstaff, and see the canyons. You will come back different. You'll see mountain lions, rattle snakes, elk, grizzly bears, and roaming wolves. It the wild, in it's condensed true form. Absorb it while you can.
