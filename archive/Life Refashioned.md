Life Refashioned
=====

If I didn't tell you before, I've been reading Darling Magazine's website. To the point of knowing what every single past article has said. I've read their entire archive. I tend to do strange things like that when I relate to something ( it almost never happens). But why am I telling you this? Well, I'm pretty sure I'm on the edge, of not just a lifestyle change, but a change also in my point of view. It's strange and a little scary. ... But for every article I've been reading and for every old book I've been attempting to find a read, there's been a shift in my reality.

I think there's a little bit of fear involved every time we experience one of those shifts. It's almost like feeling the floor falling out beneath you, but knowing you are going to bounce back up. Instead of being terrified you know it is there, but you also still have the feeling of falling that scares you half to death.

So, here's where I am today. I'm ok without the internet. I log on, check my messages, download articles to read, upload my web posts and that's it. Sometimes I'll search for a book or something for my e-reader but only if I know what I'm looking for. I've cut down my time to about 15 minues every other day. Except on days where I'm looking for a certain book.

I have an addiction forming for strange normally unused archaic words and letter writing. My poetry is improving. I've started collecting inspirational unheard of quotes. I'm reading older and longer books ( there are things longer than Harry Potter out there that are not legalese). Everything from Rilke to Thoreau's 2 million + words journal. I'm starting to hate soda and only drink it when I don't have another choice. I love mixing fruit juices with Perrier or having hot tea with cream. I have a growing addiction to drawing with oil pastels ( not sure how that happened ).

I'm addicted to Picadilly notebooks ( the extremely cheap cousin of moleskins ). I want to deck out my cruiser bicycle and use it for my main form of transport for short distances. I have no urge to purchase a car. The thought that there isn't a bakery nearby has compelled me to learn how to make english muffins, biscuits, focaccia, and ciabatta from scratch. The lack of desserts that weren't in a box has caused me to learn how to make pies, Cranberry Apple Tort, Icelandic Christmas Cake, and numerous types of cookies.

I don't like to shop new if I can help it. I've bought Itallian silver goblets, a marble cutting board, ceramic Chinese bowls, a Japanese jewelry box, and a handmade bird cage; all second hand. I look for books that are out of print. I became a poetry snob. I write all of the time. These are just a few of the changes I've noticed.

I think I've started to also invest in small experiences without knowing to. Such as, sitting at the Irish Coffee Shop for hours on end listening to the Irish reels and songs. As well as, getting a beautiful French easel, which I cannot wait to use for hours on end. These things once they start seem to keep bouncing off each other and creating more and new changes in my life. It's like I flipped the first domino and the chain of living a real life started hitting me in stages. And honestly, I'm curious about what's next in line. ...

P.S. If you have any old copies of Darling Magazine I would love to have them. I cannot afford shipping. But if you would send like to send me your old copy. I'll write you a beautiful handwritten thank you in return. You can send your copy to P.O. Box 221 Winfield, MO 63389
