I'm in a book called, "JavaScript & jQuery: the missing manual". It's been a killer of a ride the past week upping my tech skills. So, far I've ended up getting an injury in my left arm from coding so much. I'm now on chapter 6 or page 185 so far. Surprisingly jQuery is kicking my butt while JavaScript is making a lot of sense. I still have a few typo's here  and there but it's a good book. </p><p>Since I've hit the halfway point in this ebook, I've been thinking a lot on the next JavaScript book I'm going to hit. Here's a list of just a few of the JavaScript books I've been blessed with acquiring and how I'm going to bust them out.</p><p><ul><li>JavaScript & jQuery: the missing manual</li><li>Learning JavaScript</li><li>Elegant JavaScript</li><li>JavaScript the Definitive Guide</li><li>JavaScript Enlightenment</li></ul></p><p>If you are like me and hoping to up your tech skills, I have five pieces of advice. </p><p><ul><li>1.

Suddenly, you don't know who you are, you are split into several alternate fragments of the same being. All while having to write research papers and study for exams. So, what do you do? Do allow yourself to be reformed, transformed, shaped, and pushed along with the flow of the river of knowledge and students? Or do you forge your own river?</p> <p>For me, I'm forced to sit in a room and listen to people give half answers or say things such as, "Thoreau is soo boring, I had to like stop after two sentences..." Is this really how we want to portray ourselves to others? What happened to academic achievement? Of philosophical thought and long discussions?</p> <p>Today in class my instructor asked the students, if someone was injured, hurt or being hurt, is it your moral responsibility to help them? The students unanimously agreed that it was not their moral responsibility to help anyone, unless it was convienent for them or they wanted to do so. They also agreed that people should pay for their healthcare, and if they are too poor to support themselves or afford it, so be it. They shouldn't be allowed care, as long as it didn't cost them anything or effect them personally, it was alright by them.</p> <p>It was one of several disappointments I've felt lately in the classroom and on campus in general. What happened to morality? Reason? Logic? Were they pilfered and scattered on the winds? And did anyone tell these people that Social Darwinism was an awful blot in our history? Why then are these people still stuck in such a web of lies? </p> <p><center><h5>June 14  | Ebook</h5></center></p> <p>As you know, I've been writing an ebook recently. There are little hints on the front page of this website. Psst. look in the sidebar for the "coming soon". Anyway, I bet a lot of you are wondering what it's about. Well, it's about superheroes, more specifically, "<strong>Your Inner Superhero</strong>".  </p><p>I don't want to give a lot of info away yet, I'm just now pounding on the keys to finish chapter two. But if you are one of those people who love movies, specifically the heroes and the villians. This just might be a book you want to read.</p> <hr><h3>P.S.</h3> <div class="mark"> <p>  If you are looking for a past letter. Look on Github and find the file "archive".
