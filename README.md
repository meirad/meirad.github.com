This is my personal website.

Domain name is forward masked instead of using CNAME attributes with GoDaddy.

"The Life Stream has gotten a major overhaul if you haven't noticed. From now on and into eternity, it will only show posts for the past week. Then *poof!* they dissapear into a pile of glittery fairy dust."

The only part of this website that's copyrighted is the Skeleton.css etc. Currently looking for a replacement to make this website completly uncopyrighted.

This website is based on Bitters by Gwen Bell, but is not an instance of Bitters. In the future I will convert it over though.
