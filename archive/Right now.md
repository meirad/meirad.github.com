Right now I'm crashed out my parents couch with a headache. I think I got too dehydrated and hot today from being caught in traffic on the highway. Anyway, I just wanted to take this small moment in my agony to tell you about what's been happening. 
I've changed a lot in past two weeks. My entire perspective on life and how we are supposed to live is being rewritten every day. 

I've been searching forever for how to live what I believe in, to be inline with those values, that are so intrisically apart of who I am. I think I found it. After reading the "Dial Letters" by Emerson and Thoreau, as well as working through the second half of "Walden, " I realized that we live on the web way too much. 

We use apps that are actually useless in the long run because they are designed for non-stop connectivity to the computer. Since my brain and probably yours too, isn't connected to the computer via wireless connection at all times. What's the point? There isn't a need to be online all the time to have a budget, or to log on to get your task list for the day, or even to check your calendar. So why do we? Why do we constantly log on? Constantly edit that list because it isn't analog or keep logging on to check our messages? I think it's because, we forgot there was a better way. ...

So, my plan is to get a few beautiful moleskins and some stationary. I plan to write my task list by hand, following the ZTD method by Leo Babauta. My schedule will be in the style of Benjamin Franklin. My budget will be vaules based. But what does this mean?

Value based budgeting is a beautiful mixture of minimalism, Benjamin Franklin's vaule chart, an idea hot bed, budget, and project list. Basically, you start out with a normal budget, income, fixed, discretionary. Then, you get another page and write out three vaules that resound with you financially. Then, you brainstorm. 

Think of all the ways that you can live these pricipals. If you chose something like Health or Happiness as a value. You can make your own lunch sack or buy only from the farmers market. If you chose something like Independence, go debt free. Start writing letters snail mail style, save for your dream vacation etc. They are your's for the taking and living. That's what it's all about anyway; getting away from that screen your eyes are glued to and living.

If you do this, you have time for so much more in your life. Here's an example. I never get up at 6:40 am I'm a 10:00 am person. But today at HavenHouse I woke at 6:40 am. Here's what I got done before 10:00 am:

Breakfast
Brush Teeth
Shower
Pack for leaving
Charge Ipad
Cook
Pack lunch
Take a nap
Read some articles

That's a lot of stuff, I normally would have slept through. I failed to mention that I stared for about ten minutes watching a strange squirrel roll in the grass and watched the fog roll in. All things I would have hated to miss.
