I've been working my butt off on Javascript. I'm in a book called, "JavaScript & jQuery: the missing manual". It's been a killer of a ride the past week upping my tech skills. So, far I've ended up getting an injury in my left arm from coding so much. I'm now on chapter 6 or page 185 so far. Surprisingly jQuery is kicking my butt while JavaScript is making a lot of sense. I still have a few typo's here  and there but it's a good book. 

Since I've hit the halfway point in this ebook, I've been thinking a lot on the next JavaScript book I'm going to hit. 
Here's a list of just a few of the JavaScript books I've been blessed with acquiring and how I'm going to bust them out.

JavaScript & jQuery: the missing manual
Learning JavaScript
Elegant JavaScript
JavaScript the Definitive Guide
JavaScript Enlightenment

If you are like me and hoping to up your tech skills, I have five pieces of advice. 

1. Learn HTML5 & CSS3
2. Email me for links to tech ebooks to up your skills and practice programming
3. Subscribe to Gwen Bell's newsletter on tech skills. 
4. Learn Git
5. Set up an account of GitHub & bust out your hacker profile.
