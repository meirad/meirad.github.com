#A Sick Writer Never Writes, But Reads. ...
I've been reading a lot lately to recuperate from a cold. Nothing's sacred since my imagination tends to kaput when ill. I read everything. Recently, that's been a series of short stories by Jack London. He's one of my favorite author's if you didn't know. As well as,  Zen and The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance and every once in a while reading some sections of Thoreau's journal. It's hard to read it on my computer screen. But it's worth every moment for the interesting stuff you come across. Other than that in the past three days I've been rotting my brains out watching television (I don't have Netflix or Cable, straight dvd's). So, I've watched the 3 hour King Kong film with Jack Black, Bewitched, Aliens 4, and the entire second season of Teen Wolf. I've also been debating as the whether I should read Friedrich Nietzsche, and Rebel by Albert Camus. All while digging through deer hunting statistics (for no reason whatsoever) and delving into rereading whatever magazines I have. It's crazy. ...

So, What's a day in my life like lately? To quell your infinite curiosity. I've settled into two different types of days. One where I'm productive and one where i'm lazy.

##Productive Day:
I wake up and brew tea, eating Greek yogurt and powering up my mac. Double clicking iTunes, I listen to some French songs and podcasts. Then swtich over to music from my playlists. When I feel ready, I open Scrivener and Github app and write, logging my progress to put onto my repo later in the day. Afterwards I take a break for lunch which I usually cook from scratch and write in my journal. After lunch I update my website and write more until evening where I then switch to reading on my ereader.

##Lazy Day:
These are web days, research days, knowing and learning days. Usually every other day I have one of these. Keeps the mind busy and relaxed. 
I log online check my RSS feeds and email, upload all my git progress for my website and writing repo's. Then, I check the news to see what is happening in the world, download articles to read and do my research for my book. That's it. Done.

Later I might read the articles or I'll do something else like mini chores or take Oreo for a walk. But I try to keep the days simple. It's not like that all of the time though, some days I visit my brother and that tends to transform the whole day into a traveling lazy day. Where I try to fit in a little bit of research with a lot of visiting and poster making. 

[My brother loves to make art requests. He tells me a favorite Disney or cartoon character and I sketch and color him on newsprint with oil pastels. He then works on his own poster while waiting for me to finish and then we hang them on his wall. Each poster takes between 30 minutes and 3 hours.]

That's a little bit about me. You wanna make my day? Give me the title of an obsure Jack London novel. I promise to look it up and read it. :)  So far, I've read: "To Build A Fire," "Trust," "Call of the Wild," & "Lost Face."
