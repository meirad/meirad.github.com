###When the Winds Assail 
<strong><center>"Why, then, do you wonder that good men are shaken in order that they may grow strong? No tree becomes rooted and sturdy unless many a wind assails it. For by its very tossing it tightens its grip and plants its roots more securely; the fragile trees are those that have grown in a sunny valley. It is, therefore, to the advantage even of good men, to the end that they may be unafraid, to live constantly amidst alarms and to bear with patience the happenings which are ills to him only who ill supports them." ~ Seneca</center></strong>

Today, the wind assailed me. it shook me to my core, for about an hour. Here's what happened. 

Saturday my sister received a letter from our college stating that she had mistaken some information on her FAFSA and to correct it. We did and today she went to turn it in. 

When she came home, I have honestly never seen anyone more stressed. They said she would have to pay for the entire semester (even though her  Pell Grant came through). They said, she didn't qualify for college anymore, even though she has attened for two years. They told my 18 year old sister to cough up the cash and go back to highschool.

Then it hit me. Shit. Her Pell grants were worth over $5,000. Then she told me, I'm in the same boat. I'm supposed to cough up the cash as well. They said they no longer support the "Ability to Benefit" which allows alternative students to attend college.

We now may be facing payments of over $10,000 dollars on money the college accepted but wouldn't use to cover our accounts. On top of this they said it was the governments fault for allowing us to attend in the first place. That we should drop all of our classes immediately, one week away from finals.

To put it lightly, I felt as if my soul had been scraped away from my body. I was hollow. I still am a little scared. 
But what can I do? Then it hit me. I've been reading this book on Stoicism all week, this is the opportune moment to be a badass Stoic sage. 

So, Que Sera Sera. Whatever will be wiil be. I might not have been a Stoic for the first hour after hearing this news. But now that i'm writing this, I could really care less. The college we attend is manipulative and crafty, they do this to their students on an almost daily basis. What really hurt wasn't the fact that they sprung this on us last minute, or that we might have to pay $10,000 dollars that we don't have. It was the fact, that they actually told my sister to go back to highschool. That burned. 

Now that an hour has passed though, I remembered something I read. <strong>"... [W]hen we feel ourselves getting angry about something, we should pause to consider its cosmic insignificance."</strong> If this is true and the winds assail a tree to make it strong. I'm a mighty ass Stoic Oak. I don't blame them anymore. Unintelligence and ignorant policies are things everyone must deal with, and isn't it true that compared to all things, perhaps a little bit insignificant?
