This is my personal website, created with Twitter Bootstrap. 
Domain name is forward masked instead of using CNAME attributes with GoDaddy.

Index.html is the main page that uses a daily "stream" that is deleted by hand every 30 days.

In the future, this website will be overhauled to incorporate Docpad.
