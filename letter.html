The believe the author of the article is completely right. </p><p>My usual daily routine in the morning incorporates reading RSS feeds. Usually I don't have time to read them at the moment, so I toss them into Pocket. </p><p>Unfortunately, I've found that it's created an addiction. I toss articles, which I might read and then, I don't delete them. It's causing my Pocket account to grow into a monster and spiral out of control. </p><p>This kind of behavior is caused by trying to keep up to date. You pick out feeds that have the most interesting news. Then, you read the news, magazines, books, websites etc. It has to end somewhere. If not, eventually you are consumed by it. You find yourself addicted to the internet and thinking more about it, than your family, friends, and things you truley care about.</p><p>Keeping up to date is an illusion, it can be caused by addiction to the web and probably numerous other things and reasons. But, it causes so many damaging effects. </p><p>When online and speed reading articles etc. You start to think quickly, barely processing what is going on around you. You loose yourself, your mindfulness, and those around you tend to blur in the corners of your vision as you stare at the screen. </p><p>But what can you do about?</p><p>Well, it's simple. Delete everything in your Pocket or Instapaper account. I'm going to. Then, get rid of all news feeds. I mean it. No G**gle News, no NY Times, nothing. Leave the news behind. Leave all your RSS feeds except for the ones that you enjoy every time you open them to read. I try to keep my list under 10, half of these feeds only post about once a week if that. </p><p>But how do you stay curent?  Do you need to stay current? </p> <p>Realize that you were always current. You are a breathing living being that exsists in the present. Not the future. Not the past. Only now.</p> <p> 'How can I be any more up to date? I'm alive now. That's pretty current where I'm from.' ~ Dylan Moran</cite></p> <p>If you want to know more about staying ahead of the curve, while still being present. Read, "The Great Donut" by Seth Godin. I've heard rumors it was the last book he ever published. Written in 2046, teleported into the past by a clone, and placed on a bench where Ev Bogue found it, only about a week ago, and shared it with the world. </p><p>Just remember, being "current" is an illusion, being ahead of everyone else only requires being yourself, doing what you believe in, and doing it now. Not doing what others are doing or being what other people are. </p><hr><h3>Notes</h3> <div class="mark"><p>This is an experiment in replacing Tiny Letter.
