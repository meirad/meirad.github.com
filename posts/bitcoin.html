I remember thinking that It was just something stupid like Facebook's virtual currency. Then I started reading about it over a year ago, logged on to <a href="http://www.preev.com">Preev</a> and checked out what they were worth. This year I finally took the plunge and invested what little money I had ( Like some many other's these days, I don't have a job) into bitcoin. I came up with 0.210044 bitcoins. It's not a lot, but it's a start.<br><br>         Bitcoins represent an international currency and their value will only go up with time. I can see in the future, traveling overseas and buying a tea in a local restraunt using only bitcoins. What's better? If you earn in bitcoins, there are no conversion fees. When I went to Germany in 2005, the euro was worth about $1.55 or so. Everytime I would purchase something, that was an extra $0.55 tacked on per dollar. If bitcoin had been around at the time and at it's current value, I wouldn't of had to pay it at all.          <br><br>         But that's not all. You manage your money yourself. There isn't anyone else who holds on to your money for you. Both a liberating and also slightly scary feeling. But, If a bank collapses or another Cyprus event happens again, your money is safe. In the U.S. if a bank fails and it is FDIC insured, they are responsible for giving you on $0.30 cents for every dollar. With Bitcoins, you still have your money for another day.         <br><br>         So, will you take the plunge and invest in bitcoins? Or will you let the banks invest and manipulate your money for you? If you haven't chosen, that's fine. I'm still on dollars as well. , although it would be nice to work only with bitcoins. In the meantime, I'm leaving my brick and mortar bank. I have a SimpleCard, which allows me to bank for essentially free anywhere in the world. You should check it out.          <br><br>         Also check out community currencies, they keep the money in your community, while allowing you to invest in something not tied to the dollar. If there isn't one in your area, why not start one?</div>      </article>    </div>    <div class="span4"><img title="" src="http://meirad.github.com/Index/578235_619943104688227_314994455_n copy.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 1em" class="img-polaroid">     <p class="lead">     Hi, I'm Meira.
