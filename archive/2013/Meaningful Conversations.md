Meaningful Conversations
12 Apr 2013 |

When was the last time you had a conversation that left you energized? Most of the time i'm left feeling drained and tired after a conversation. Not for lack of trying to communicate. But for a lack of dialogue between me and the person I am talking to. It seems the art of conversation has died.

I read an interesting quote today that said,

"Conversation is the laboratory and workshop of the student." by Ralph Waldo Emerson.

Without dialog, without conversation, we aren't truely sharing and learning with other people. We are monologing. ... Stifling innovation and creativity. Creating "mindsmog". It's beyond time that we take back the art of conversing with one another...
