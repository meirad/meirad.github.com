Changing of the Seasons
====
A lot has been changing. The weather swishes back and forth between the depths of summer heat and the beauty of a light and cool autumn. My personality is as moody as the weather. … For a long time now, I've felt that someone handed me a foam Nerf sword to battle dragons. The dragons were those of poverty, health collapses in my family, and the struggle to find who I am in comparison to who people want me to be or who they think I should be.

 It's a struggle. … I live in the middle of nowhere. A small town encompassed by fields of yellowed corn. They were black last year, the summer heat scorched them dry. … I live in the country, where people drink beer and talk big about winning the powerball, because all opportunity has been sapped, leaving them broken. I was almost one of them. … Not the drinking part, but the broken part. … I'm still struggling, but I'm getting better. Things change, like the shifting of the seasons, and sometimes change is good. 
 
 For me it's involved a lot of decisions. Do I listen to what people say around me? About me? How they drag my family name into the dirt out of spite? Do I listen to the dramatic whispers of the church goers? Or do I forge my own path? The answer has been obvious. If you can't leave, at least change your cirucumstances, and if you can't do that, change yourself. 
 
 Lately, I've been keeping a small notebook of quotes. Not just any quotes. But quotes that resound with me. I have a few favorites, I'd like to share.
 
 "You cannot receive a shock, unless you have an electric affinity for that which shocks you. Have no affinity for what is shocking." ~ Thoreau
 
 "Hell is empty because all the devils are here." ~ Shakespeare
 
 "The purpose of a writer is to keep civilization from destroying itself." ~ A. Camus
 
 "My blood is alive with many voices that tell me I am made of longing." ~ Rilke
 
 "As to conforming outwardly and living your own life inwardly, I don not think much of that." ~ Thoreau
 
 "Behind every exquisite thing that existed, there was a tragic past." ~ Oscar Wilde
 
 "To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment." ~ Ralph Waldo Emerson
 
 The point of sharing these few quotes with you, is that no matter how tragic your circumstances. If you strive bravely, and move forward to change yourself and to be yourself. You just might find out you are exqusite. Something that people see and are amazed by. 
 
 Did you know Audrey Hepburn, one of the women, that many of us believe to be beautiful, both inwardly and outwardly. Lived during the time of Nazi occupation in Holland? She helped the Dutch resistance by raising money and carrying messages inside her shoes. Not only that, but she also helped a British paratrooper to safety without the Nazi's finding out. There are countless stories of amazing women who in terrible times stayed true to themselves and held fast despite what others thought. And today, everyone agrees that they were exquisite.
 
 That's what I hope to acomplish. Not by deeds, at least not yet. But with the small steps of finding out who I am and staying completely true to it. What I didn't expect was the amount of rejection associated with it. I knew that there was acceptance out there somewhere. But rejection? That was new to me. But then, looking back at women like Hepburn, you think. I bet they were rejected a lot too. If not for their strong wills, character, and ideals, these women would not have been the people we look up to today. They would have just been pretty faces and would have never become the exquisite people we believe them to be today. … 
 
 So, the question is, how do you plan to be yourself amid the darkest of days? Eventually, you'll see the light. Until then, be yourself and push on. Your Nerf sword is actually stronger than it appears. Its as strong as you believe yourself to be. ...
