Visits To The Hospital

Something out of the blue happened to us (me and my family) yesterday. I wasn't there for all of it, so I'll tell you what they told me. My family (which includes my mother, father, little sister, and little brother) went shopping. Then they stopped off a Wendy's to grab a bite to eat. My brother started complaining that his legs were falling asleep and wobbled to the car. They then stopped off at Walgreens to pick up their medication. My brother started yelling to be brought home because he couldn't feel his legs, so they headed home without grabbing the medication. 

Fast forward to home.  (This is where I come in)

Everyone was getting out of the car and rushing grocceries in. My dad got out of the car, turned around and saw my brother hanging out of the car and in the grass. He said he couldn't walk. My dad with his high blood pressure and heart problems lifted him off the ground and supported his entire weight to get him inside the house. He said his legs felt tingly. He couldn't stand and started moaning in frustration because he wanted to watch his new movie "Coraline". 

We tried rubbing his legs, helping him into a chair etc. He slid out. He didn't have any control of his legs at all. Then his eye started getting red and drooping. He could and still only can open it halfway and it's still red. We called an ambulance, believing that it was that his legs were just asleep anymore. They had to carry him to the ambulance. We were at the hospital from 4-11 last night. 

Over half that time the doctors believed him to be faking it and wanted to send him home unable to walk. Then they started doing tests, after my brother insisted he couldn't walk and tried to repetedly. By this time, he lost all functioning in his right arm. He actually punched himself in the face accidently. Then they finally got worried and decided to transfer him to a children's hospital. Where they drew the conclusion that since he isn't faking it, he must have been abused. Isn't it amazing how medical staff can draw the wrong conclusions because they are too lazy to look for the answer? 

Now he cannot go to the bathroom and they still haven't found the problem. They are saying it's neurological. My brother has autism and a few other disorders that keep him from knowing how to tell the doctors what's wrong. What baffles me is how they think that this would result in him lying and I quote "translating kidney stone pain as weakness in the legs." 

Today, I'm sitting at home. Someone has to take Oreo outside every few hours. I packed my brother two stuffed animals, some movies, etc. I promised him I'd get him netflix. I have $5 out of the $8 I need. If anyone could be so kind as to help out with the $3 dollars I would be grateful. 

I wish I was there today. I have no way to get updates on his condition and it is driving me up a wall. $40 bucks if anyone cares to donate for a month of cell service. I miss him. I miss his weird "flashlight eyes". He can't open wide anymore and give his spooky alert look. His eye won't open enough and he's on too much pain medication to be that alert. 

I honestly would be grateful for any and all donations to help my brother. We are currently out of work and it's an hour drive to get to St.Louis one way. We can't afford the gas, and there's no way in hell we are going to leave him there alone. 

So please donate, pray, etc. When he gets well (I'm not allowing any other option) I'll ask him to post a thank you video for all your support.
