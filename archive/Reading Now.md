Reading Now:

I've been reading a ton lately, while busy shuttling back and forth to the hospital to visit my brother. So, I thought I would include a small running list here. Just until my brother recovers. It's been a really rough time and I don't feel like I should talk about it just yet, so in the meantime, there is the list.

- Poems by Robert Frost
- Rilke's Letter's to a Young Poet
- August Rodin by Rilke
- Thoreau's letters to Emerson

P.S. Lately me any my sister have been extremely bored on the 55+ mile drive one way to the hospital, so we've been working on numerous lists. One of them being the best multi-inventors, another for great muscians etc. When we are finished, I'll post them. *Hint: Tesla made the list.
